Scobey2.0\n
=========\n
\n
I am making a new website for my professor, Dr. Porter Scobey. \n
Given Dr Scobey's website is very vast and extensive, it is not feasible to simply rewrite each page by hand. \n
Instead, I am creating this website as a layer to his original, such that changes he makes to the original website will then be reflected, after being upgraded of course, to Scobey 2.0 website format.
