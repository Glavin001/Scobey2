Scobey2.0
=========

I am making a new website for my professor, Dr. Porter Scobey. 
Given Dr Scobey's website is very vast and extensive, it is not feasible to simply rewrite each page by hand.
Instead, I am creating this website as a layer to his original, such that changes he makes to the original website will then be reflected, after being upgraded of course, to Scobey 2.0 website format.
