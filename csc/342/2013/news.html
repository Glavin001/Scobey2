    <li>First the bad news ... unfortunately, neither of the solutions
    to the "Week 05 In-Lab Exercise" that I pronounced to be correct in
    the lab was actually correct. The even-worse news is that it took
    me a while to figure out why my tester didn't pick up on the problems.
    The short story is that I was actually running *my* solution instead
    of yours and, fortunately, my solution was correct. The even-worse news
    is that one of the submitted solutions that I pronounced "correct"
    had clearly not even been tested since it contained a syntax error.
    We should all (including yours truly) be ashamed ... :) More on this
    on Wednesday, so I hope all concerned will be present.</li>

      <li><big>Important Note</big>
      You will be permitted to have with you, during the final exam in CSCI 2342,
      a sheet of paper, up to legal size (8 and 1/2 inches by 14 inches),
      containing whatever information you think may be helpful to you (on one
      or both sides, as you wish). There are no limitations on content or font
      size. There are, however, some conditions:
      <ul class="hardleft">
      <li>You must have your name in the upper right corner of at least
      one side of the sheet, so that I may hand it out to you at the
      beginning of the exam period. If you want to work on the preparation
      of such a sheet with one or more other students in the class, that's
      fine. In other words, two or more people may submit identical sheets,
      exept for identification.</li>
      <li>You must prepare the hard copy of your sheet and hand it in to me
      no later than noon on Monday, April 15 (the day before the exam). I will
      not accept any sheets after that time, and will not accept any by email.
      If I am not around when you come by my office (MN126) to drop it off,
      please slide it under the door. Once I have started to receive these
      sheets, I will maintain on the course What's New page a list of those
      from whom I've received a sheet. You will be able to look there for
      confirmation that I have your sheet.</li>
      <li>This is an "optional requirement". You are not <em>required</em>
      to prepare such a sheet.</li>
      </ol>

    <li>The demo executable for Submission 07 has been revised as of
    Mon Feb 25 19:17:31 AST 2013, so you should download the revised
    version if you downloaded a previous version. Please test the
    revised version to confirm that it behaves better when invalid
    input is entered ... :)

    <p>The following is an e-mail I received from Melanie Williams
    of HB Studios on Friday, February 22. I'd be surprised if you
    don't find it interesting on several levels. Stay tuned for
    further information.
<pre>
Hello Dr. Scobey, Dr. Muir, and Dr. Oore,

My name is Melanie Williams and I'm the Director of Operations at HB Studios.
We are a video game developer located in Lunenburg, NS (see company overview
below).  I'm reaching out to you today to see if it is possible to do a quick
meet and greet next week (say Wednesday or Thursday) and maybe chat with some
of your students briefly about career opportunities at HB Studios.  We are
currently hiring Software Engineers (aka ProgrammersÔÅä) to fill roughly 10
positions.  We are interested in graduates in April/May but also open to 3rd
year co-op students who are able to do a minimum 8 month term.  Our last co-op
student from SMU, Harry McCleave, turned out to be a great employee and
addition to the HB Team!

I've emailed Professor Lingras as well.  I'm sure there is overlap with your
students so I am open to suggestions to which class(es) would be most
appropriate.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Melanie Williams
Director of Operations
HB Studios

    <li>The results of Quiz 01 are available on Blackboard.
    The papers will be returned on Monday, so you can have them
    with you when we discuss the problems in the recitation.</li>

    <p>2013.01.25</p>
    <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>There is a new link in the menu panel to the left entitled
    "Subversion" which tells how to use Subversion on cs in conjunction
    with TortoiseSVN on your Windows machine (or some equivalent
    "client" software on the Windows or a Mac). If you still have
    no idea what Subversion is, wait for the in-class discussion.
    If you already know, you may want to try it out, using this
    page as a guide. If you do, please let me know on Monday how
    it went.</li>

    The following message is more or less self explanatory. If you

    We've had a request from Dr. Farrell in the Sobey School of
    Business to identify science students who may be interested
    in chatting / sharing ideas with the business students on
    entrepreneurial ventures. She and Todd Murphy (an alum and
    start-up entrepreneur - Blueprint, MedRunner and OneLobby)
    have recently had discussions about the importance of
    entrepreneurs and scientists collaborating to effectively
    raise money for new business/projects. They are hoping to
    organize a 'pizza night' at the end of the month with perhaps
    10 or so students from each faculty.

    <li>Here is Keith Bain's e-mail, as promised: 
    <a href="mailto:Keith.Bain@smu.ca">Keith.Bain@smu.ca</a>.
    Please send a short e-mail giving him some feedback
    of your impressions of the software demonstrated in
    the lab on Monday. Thanks ... and here are some suggestions
    from Keith himself for items you may wish to comment on
    in particular:
<pre>
1. Any thoughts/impressions about the demonstration they witnessed
2. Would this technology be beneficial for their own learning?
3. Any ideas for features/functionality that could enhance the system
4. Any other general comments/feedback
</pre>

    <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>I hope the demo executable for Submission 02
    is now downloadable (on campus,
    where there was a problem ... there should have been no problem
    in any case if you were anywhere that Sophos is not installed,
    either at home or on campus).
    If you are on campus, please try downloading the file and let
    me know if you are still prevented from doing so by Sophos.
    In any case, I have placed a copy of the file on the Q:
    drive, from where you can copy it if you are on campus (but
    only from your csc342?? account, of course).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>2013.01.16</p>
    <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>There seems to be a problem with downloading the sample
    executable for Submission 02, caused by Sophos (the campus
    desktop virus detector) refusing to let you do this.
    I have re-created the file and also placed a copy in the
    misc subdirectory under the Sample Code link. If you could
    try that and let me know whether that works, that would be
    helpful. Meanwhile, the ITSS folks are "on the case".</li>
    </ol>
    <p>2013.01.07</p>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>Email restrictions on csc342?? accounts
      <br />
       The csc342?? accounts can send e-mail, but traditionally have not
      been able to receive it. In any case, it is probably not a good idea
      to send from your csc342?? account any e-mail to which you expect a
      reply. Use your personal account for e-mail instead, and be sure to
      identify yourself by signing your name, or you may not get a
      reply.</li>
      <li>
        Don't confuse these three (very different) things: 
        <ul class="hardleft">
          <li>Your personal Saint Mary's account (s???????), and its
          password, which you also use to access your MyCourses link when
          you log in to SMUport, which is where you will find your marks on
          the weekly submissions and your mid-term mark.</li>
          <li>Your course account (csc342??) for this course, and its
          password, which you will receive in the second class. You must
          use this account for all work in the course when you are on
          campus, since your personal account will not have the required
          setting for some actions.</li>
          <li>
            Your username and password for the protected part of the web
            site for this course. 
            <p>Initially <b>both your username and your
            password</b> for the course web site are your SMU ID number,
            namely <b>A00??????</b>.</p>
            Your username for this site will remain your A-number, but you
            must change your password when you log in.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If you do not have an account on "the cs machine" (our department's
      Linux server) you should see our technician Andrew Valencik in MN118 to obtain
      one, since we will likely be discussing something called Subversion at
      some point this term, and for which you will want such an account. You
      should get familiar with Linux in any case, and having such an account
      is a good start.</li>
