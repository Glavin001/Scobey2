    <h3>Important Notes on the Grading Scheme</h3>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>To compute each student's mark on the on-line submission portion
      of the final grade, the lowest mark on any submission will be dropped
      from consideration, and the remaining marks will be averaged. This
      means that each student has one "free" submission (one that does not
      have to be handed in, or more accurately, one that can be missed if
      special circumstances lead to such an unfortunate occurrence, since
      all students are encouraged strongly to hand in all required
      submissions). In any case, there is only one "free" submission,
      however interpreted, and after that there is a penalty for
      non-submission.</li>
      <li><em><b>Late submissions will not be accepted, in any form, for
      any reason. Students should note that it is particularly distasteful
      to receive them as e-mail attachments or as hard-copies slid under my
      office door, when a perfectly adequate on-line submission mechanism
      is in place. So, please don't send them as e-mail or slide them under
      my door.</b></em></li>
      <li>Either the mid-term will contribute 30% and the final exam will
      contribute 40%, or the mid-term will contribute 10% and the final
      exam will contribute 60%, whichever favors the student.</li>
      <li><em><b>If a student makes less than 50% on both the mid-term and
      the final, or makes less than 40% on the final, that student will not
      pass the course, irrespective of the total point value including the
      submission portion of the grade. If a student misses or opts not to
      write the mid-term and fails the final, that student will not pass
      the course.</b></em></li>
      <li>
        The length of the final exam will be the longer of the following
        two times: 
        <ul>
          <li>three hours</li>
          <li>however long it takes 2/3 of those students actually writing
          to finish and hand in their papers, plus 1/2 hour</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>All students who miss a mid-term or final exam and are given the
      opportunity to write that paper late must write it at the same time
      and in the same location.</li>
      <li>It is impossible to arrange for each required on-line submission
      to involve the same amount of time and effort for completion, so
      students should note any differences carefully, and plan
      accordingly.</li>
      <li>The total numerical grade determined on the basis of the
      percentages in the above table will be the key factor, but not the
      only factor, in assigning a final letter grade for the course. A
      passing grade for the course may <em>not</em> be given if a student
      has clearly <em>not</em> made an honest effort to complete all parts
      of the course, so any student who ignores any significant portion of
      the required work does so at his or her own peril.</li>
      <li>Attendance, although it is not allotted any direct point value,
      is also regarded as important, as noted in the <a
      href="../../common_341_342/rules/rules_general.html">General Rules
      and Policies for the Course</a>.</li>
      <li>Actual letter grades will be assigned according to the scheme
      outlined in the university calendar, and based on the numerical total
      calculated according to the above table.</li>
