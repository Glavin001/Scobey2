    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This week you will design and write (another?) program to encrypt and
    decrypt textfiles. Such programs are nice exercises because they always
    involve making good choices for the structures and algorithms you need to
    use, and they require you (or should require you) to think through your
    approach before starting in a way that some other exercises do not.</p>
    <p>Also, because you now have quite a number of STL facilities at your
    disposal, you have quite a variety of things to choose from when solving
    any problem with a C++ program, including this one. So, feel free to
    choose and use whatever works, from the STL and (of course) from the
    <tt>utilities.h/.obj</tt> package. In fact, think of this as another
    opportunity to get your "STL chops" up to speed.</p>
    <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>Copy the demo executable and the accompanying text items file that
      it needs in order to run.</li>
      <li>Study the program description (especially the encryption scheme
      description) you get by choosing option 2 from the menu.</li>
      <li>Make up a few short (or long, if you like) textfiles and try
      encrypting and decrypting them. Enter different phrases for doing so
      from they keyboard and from a file. Do this until you understand how
      the program works.</li>
      <li>Write pseudocode for a solution to this problem, and revise it
      until you are convinced that a program that implements your pseudocode
      will be the one you want.</li>
      <li>Translate your pseudocode into C++ and continue testing your
      program until you are convinced it works correctly.</li>
      <li>Make sure your source code is identified, formatted, and documented
      properly, according to our current rules and guidelines.</li>
      <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
    any)</h3>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>The phrase used for encrypting/decrypting must be just a single
      line of text.</li>
      <li>To compare two files (as in option 6 on the menu), your program
      need only use the system <tt>fc</tt> command (for "file compare"). Your
      program should build the appropriate C-string containing this command
      and the names of the two files to be compared, and then pass it as the
      parameter in a call to the <tt>system()</tt> function.</li>
      <li>Don't forget to include in your testing files that are encrypted
      by your program and decrypted by the sample executable, and vice
      versa.</li>
    </ol>
