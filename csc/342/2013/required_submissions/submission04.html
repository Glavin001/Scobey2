  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>This week your task is to write a program that produces, and displays
  on the standard output or writes to a file, a "concordance" for a file of
  text.</p>

  <p>The Oxford American Dictionary defines "concordance" like this: "An
  index of the important words used in a book or an author's writings." Our
  use of the term will be somewhat more liberal. Here is our meaning: "A
  concordance is a list (in alphabetical order) of all words contained in a
  file, with each word on a separate line and followed by a list (in
  increasing numerical order) of all line numbers of the lines of the file
  in which the word appears." Concordances are very useful to writers when
  they are preparing indexes for their books, for example.</p>

  <p>We also have a very particular meaning for the term "word" in this
  context. A "word" will be any contiguous string of alphabetic characters,
  i.e., any contiguous string of upper case and/or lower case letters.
  Thus, for example, what we would normally think of as the single word
  "can't" contains, in this context, two "words", namely "can" and "t".
  Among other things, this means that our concordance program views some
  sequences of letters as "words" that would not be considered words in the
  ordinary everyday sense of the term.</p>

  <p>Also, all words are considered to be in lower case. Thus, in our
  concordance, "John", "john" and "JOHN" would all be regarded as the same
  word, namely "john".</p>

  <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>

  <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>Download the sample executable and its accompanying text items
    file.</li>

    <li>Run the program and study the program description until you
    understand what the input and output of this program are supposed to
    look like.</li>

    <li>Now try the program on several textfiles of widely varying size and
    content to get a good feel for the kind of output produced.</li>

    <li>Choose an appropriate data structure for this problem and write
    pseudocode for a solution.</li>

    <li>Revise your solution until you are convinced that a program that
    implements your pseudocode will be the one you want.</li>

    <li>Translate your pseudocode into C++ and continue testing your
    program until you are convinced it works correctly.</li>

    <li>When you are finished, make sure your source code file is
    identified, formatted, and documented properly.</li>

    <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
  any)</h3>

  <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>The third command-line parameter, if there is one, should be the
    name of a concordance file produced by the sample executable (or any
    other program that produces a concordance file in the proper format),
    whose contents are to be compared with those of the file appearing as
    the second command-line parameter (the output from your program, let's
    say). A list of the differences will be placed in a file called
    <tt>differences.txt</tt>. This will be useful for testing your
    program.</li>

    <li>Note that you are only submitting a single source code file for
    this Submission, so all of your source code has to be in that file. You
    may just opt to have a <code>main()</code> function, with additional
    functions to do various tasks, or you may wish to create a
    <code>Concordance</code> class to handle all the concordance-related
    activities. If you opt to write such a class, put your class specification
    (what would normally go into a separate <code>.h</code> file)
    <em>before</em> your <code>main()</code>, and the definitions of your
    class member functions (what would normally go into your implementation
    (<code>.cpp</code>) file corresponding to your <code>.h</code> file)
    <em>after</em> your <code>main()</code> function.</li>
  </ol>
