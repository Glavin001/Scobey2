  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>This week you will write a short (one page) program that will permit
  the user to randomly generate a fixed number of names and then to display
  those names in various ways. The size of the program is limited so that
  you are forced to think about the best ways to accomplish the various
  tasks. You will need to make good use of the facilities provided by
  (among other things) the Standard Template Library, and the string class.
  Successful completion of this program should give you some confidence
  that you are "up and running" for the new term.</p>

  <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>

  <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>Download the sample executable and run it. Generate several groups
    of names and display them in all possible ways until you are sure you
    understand the program's behavior. Note in particular that once a given
    group of names has been generated (option 3), then any of the
    higher-numbered options (4, 5, 6, 7) may be chosen any number of times
    in any order and the same output will appear each time for any given
    option. To get a different group of names the user must choose option 3
    again.</li>

    <li>Now download and study the supplied source code file
    <tt>process_names.hpp</tt>. The <tt>.hpp</tt> extension signifies an
    include file that contains complete code for any functions in it. Thus
    it is a bit more than just a <tt>.h</tt> file, which would have only
    prototypes of the functions in it. This use of the <tt>.hpp</tt>
    extension is reasonably typical, though not perhaps a universally
    observed convention. The content of this file may be included in your
    own program file, and is designed both to save you some "busy work",
    and to permit you to keep the size of your program within the single-page
    limit.</li>

    <li>Write pseudocode for a solution of this problem and revise it until
    you are convinced that a program that implements your pseudocode will
    be the one you want. Keep in mind as you do this that your final
    program must not exceed a <em>single page</em> of code, according to
    Visual C++'s notion of a "page" (66 lines). One of those lines will, of
    course, be a <tt>#include</tt> directive which includes the file
    <tt>process_names.hpp</tt>.</li>

    <li>Translate your pseudocode into a C++ program and continue testing
    until you are convinced the program works correctly.</li>

    <li>Make a final check to ensure your source code is identified,
    formatted, and documented properly. This week, and from now on, you
    must make sure that each of your submissions follows the necessary
    guidelines.</li>

    <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
  any)</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Remember that the maximum length of your source code submission is
    66 lines, and the first three of those lines must contain the usual
    required identification information and look like
      <pre xml:space="preserve">
//process_names.cpp
//Lastname:Firstname:A00??????:csc342??
//Submission 01: Processing Names
</pre>except that the second line must be altered to contain your own
information.
    </li>

    <li>When your program runs, the opening screen must contain the same
    three lines of information as the sample executable, except that the
    personal information must be yours. This must be produced by a call
    to the <code>DisplayOpeningScreen()</code> function from the instructor-supplied
    <code>utilities</code> package.</li>

    <li>The only change you may make in the file <tt>process_names.hpp</tt>
    is the obvious one: the definition of the constant
    <tt>MY_ID_INFO</tt>, the first parameter for the <code>DisplayOpeningScreen()</code> function.</li>

    <li>On this occasion you may omit the self-assessment comment in your
    source code file, which will also help limit the size of your source code
    file.</li>

    <li>If you need to define a short helper function (you may well wish to
    do so), you may relax the usual formatting requirements and place the
    complete header (with parameters) on a single line.</li>

    <li>You may <b>not</b> relax our rule that requires matching braces to align
    vertically, nor the usual four-space indentation level requirement. Also, 
    the requirement that 
    all statements at a given level must align vertically continues to apply as well.</li>

    <li>You need not have any comments other than the three lines at the
    beginning of your file, but that means you need to be extra careful to
    choose good identifier names and do whatever else it takes to make your
    code as readable (self-documenting) as possible.</li>

    <li>You will, of course, find the <tt>random_shuffle()</tt> algorithm
    useful. In order for it to produce a different randomization each time
    you call the algorithm, and in particular each time you start the
    program. you should call the <tt>srand()</tt> function first, with its
    input supplied by a call to the <tt>time()</tt> function. [See
    <tt>random_functions.cpp</tt> in the <tt>random</tt> subdirectory under
    the Sample Code link on the course home page.]</li>

    <li>You may write the program assuming that menu option 3 will always
    be called before any of the higher-numbered options. In other words, no
    error checking or reporting is done if the user fails to do this.
    However, since this is a menu-driven program it should behave in the
    "usual" way if the user enters an invalid menu choice three times in a
    row. In other words, it should behave like the sample executable and
    although most of this behavior is supplied by the class itself, not all
    of it is. To be more specific, your main program must behave in the
    same way whether the user chooses to quit or is forced to quit. All of
    this may be easily achieved by using the <code>Menu</code> class from 
    the instructor-supplied <code>utilities</code> package.</li>

    <li><font color="red">In addition to any other point deductions, the
    marker will deduct one point for each line exceeding the maximum of 66
    lines for this program.</font></li>
