  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>This week your task is to put some regular expressions to work
  analyzing and reformatting a textfile of input data. The input textfile
  must contain two lines of data for each of an arbitray number of
  individuals. The two lines for any given individual look like this:</p>
  <pre>
Lastname:Firstname:A00123456:csc34201
(902)420-5790
</pre>

  <p>The first of these two lines, in each case, may be assumed to be
  correct, and to have the format shown above. The only thing you need to
  note here is that <code>Lastname</code> may contain a blank space, a
  dash, or an apostrophe (single quote), while Firstname consists only of
  letters.</p>

  <p>The second line, in each case, contains a (North American style) phone
  number, with no leading or trailing spaces. In other words, there must be
  nothing on the second line but the phone number. However, this phone
  number may or may not be a "valid" phone number. To be "valid", in our
  context, a phone number must satisfy the following criteria:</p>

  <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>It must have a 3-digit <em>area code</em>, a 3-digit
    <em>exchange</em>, and a 4-digit <em>number</em>. We refer to these as
    the "three parts" of the phone number.</li>

    <li>The three parts of the phone number may be separated by nothing, by
    a space, by a dash, or by a period. When there are no parenthese around
    the area code, whatever (if anything) separates the first and second
    part must also separate the second and third parts. That is, for
    example, you cannot have a dash separating the area code and exchange,
    with a period separating the exchange and the number in that
    exchange.</li>

    <li>The area code may, or may not be enclosed in parentheses. That is,
    if one of the parentheses is present, the other must be present as
    well. If the area code is enclosed in parentheses, the exchange either
    begins immediately after the right parenthesis, or is separated from it
    by a single blank space, and the exchange and number may then be
    separated by nothing, by a space, by a dash, or by a period.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The three lines of output corresponging to the above two lines of
  input, when the phone number is valid, look like this:</p>
  <pre>
Name .......... Firstname Lastname
                SMU ID: A00123456   Account: csc34201
                (902)405-2585       Area code: 902  Exchange: 405  Number: 2585
</pre>

  <p>When the phone number is <em>not</em> valid, the three lines of output
  corresponding to the above two lines of input look like this:</p>
  <pre>
Name .......... Firstname Lastname
                SMU ID: A00123456  Account: csc34201
                Invalid number: (902)405!2585
</pre>

  <p>The information output for each eight individuals (24 lines) occupies
  one standard screen, with room for a pause at the bottom.</p>

  <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>

  <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>Download the sample executable and run it without any command-line
    parameters. It simply displays the usual opening screen and then
    terminates. The program does not provide a self-description, so you
    need to look here for what you need to know.</li>

    <li>Spend some time creating a good test input file, one that you will
    be comfortable using as test input for your own program. Run the demo
    executable with this file as you are creating it, after adding each
    pair of lines for a new individual. This should serve the dual purpose
    of giving you a good feeling for how the program works, and providing
    an excellent test suite for your development.</li>

    <li>When you understand what is required, write pseudocode for a
    program to emulate this executable and revise it until you are
    convinced that an implementation of your pseudocode will solve the
    problem.</li>

    <li>Translate your pseudocode into C++ and continue testing your
    program until you are convinced it works correctly.</li>

    <li>Make sure your source code is identified, formatted, and documented
    properly, according to our current rules and guidelines.</li>

    <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
  any)</h3>

  <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>Although there is no formal requirement this time around to keep
    your code at a single page or less, you should be aware that the
    program <em>can</em> be done under that restriction. That is, it can be
    done in a page or less when you use regular expressions, which is part
    of the requirement. Your program would likely have to be <em>much</em>
    longer if you did <em>not</em> use regular expressions.</li>

    <li>Here are some valid phone numbers:
      <pre>
9024205790
902 420 5790
902-420-5790
902.4205.790
(902)4205790
(902) 420 5790
(902)420-5790
(902)420.5790
</pre>And here are some invalid phone numbers:
      <pre>
902 4205790
902420 5790
902420-5790
902.4205790
(902) 4205790
(902)420 5790
(902)-420-5790
(902).4205790
</pre>
    </li>
