process_club_members.txt
========================================
ProgramDescription
This program reads in a textfile of "club members" and transfers the club
member data in the file to a "working binary file". The data in that binary
file may then be displayed, in whole or in part, new members may be added,
the data on current members may be updated, and eventually all data can be
written back out to another (or the same) textfile for "archiving" purposes.
In fact, this last action should be the final one at the end of each session,
or the last one before another textfile of club members is read in.

Menu option 3 lets the user enter the name of a textfile of club members,
which are then read and placed in a binary file of club members. The data
in the textfile consists of two lines like this for each club member:

John Smith
23 $34.75

The first line contains the name of the member, while the second line contains
the member's age and current balance in the club account. Once the binary file
has been created and loaded with all data from the input textfile, it is left
open for reading and writing until menu option 8 is chosen.

Menu option 4 lets the user display all club member data in the working binary
file. Each member's data is displayed on three lines like this:
                                                                 Screen 1 of 3
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
====================
John Smith
Age: 19  Balance: $47.53
Also, there is a pause after every 8 members are displayed.

Menu option 5 lets the user display all club member data for which the member's
name contains a search string entered by the user. The format is the same as
above, but there is no pause after each 8 members, since is unlikely that many
members will be displayed.

Menu option 6 lets the user enter data for a new club member. The new member
is added to the end of the working binary file.

Menu option 7 lets the user update any or all data for a single club member
in the working binary file.

Menu option 8 lets the user enter the name of a textfile to which all data in
the binary file is then written. Next, both files are closed. Finally, the
working binary file is deleted.

Menu option 9 lets the user display any textfile, whose name is input by the
user. The file is displayed one screen at a time. An error is reported if the
file cannot be opened.                                          Screen 2 of 3
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The program also recognizes and reports the following errors:

1. A problem with opening an input textfile (menu option 3) or an output
textfile (option 8), or with opening the binary working file (option 3).

2. Trying to use the binary working file in some way (menu options 4 to 8)
before it has been loaded from the textfile and is "open for business".

3. Entering a invalid choice of action when updating member data.

4. Not supplying a search string that will uniquely identify a club member
when updating.

The errors produced when an invalid menu choice is entered, or a request is
made to display a non-existent textfile after choosing menu option 9 are
generated by the Menu class and the DisplayTextfile() free function from the
utilities package. You do not have to write code to produce these errors.
