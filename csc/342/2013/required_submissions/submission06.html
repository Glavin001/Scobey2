  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>For this submission you will write a program that reads in "club
  member" information from a textfile and then writes it out to a binary
  "working" file which is left open so that it may be "processed" by
  modifying the data in it, adding new data to it, and displaying all or
  some of the data in it. Once the processing is finished, the data in the
  binary file must be written out to an "updated" textfile, so that the
  whole process may be repeated at some later time. This final step does
  not happen automatically, and it is the responsibility of the user to
  pick the appropriate menu option as the last step before quitting the
  program.</p>

  <p>The data in an input textfile of the required type contains two lines
  of information for each "club member" of some club. The two lines look
  like this (name on the first line, age and club account balance on the
  second):</p>

  <p>Such a textfile may contain information on any number of club members.
  The output textfile, obtained by writing the binary working file, must be
  given the same format, so that it can be used as an input textfile for a
  future run of the program.</p>

  <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>

  <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>Download the sample executable and its accompanying text items
    file, and run the program. Choose menu option 2 and study the program
    description until you feel comfortable with how you expect the program
    to behave.</li>

    <li>Create at least a couple of sample input textfiles, a short one of
    four or five club members, and another one of more than sixteen club
    members (note that club members are displayed eight at a time when all
    the data in the working binary file is displayed).</li>

    <li>Now download the <code>club_members.h</code> file and study the
    comments documenting the functions you have to write. Study as well the
    doxygen-produced HTML documentation for these functions.</li>

    <li>Design the functions you will need for a solution to this problem,
    and write the necessary pseudocode for them.</li>

    <li>Revise your solution until you are convinced that the functions
    that implement your pseudocode will be the ones you need.</li>

    <li>Begin translating your pseudocode into C++. Think about the best
    order to use for implementing the required functions, and try to use
    the supplied driver (the <code>.obj</code> file) for your testing. You
    may use the supplied <code>club_members_shell.cpp</code> file to start,
    since it contains some of the "busy work" already done for you.</li>

    <li>Continue testing your program (ideally using the supplied driver)
    until you are convinced it works correctly.</li>

    <li>When you are finished, build the final version of your executable
    using your function file and the supplied driver, and make sure your
    source code file is identified, formatted, and documented
    properly.</li>

    <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
  any)</h3>

  <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>For this submission you are expressly forbidden to use
    <strong>any</strong> STL containers or algorithms. This "forces" you to
    work directly with the binary file on disk, rather that reading the
    data from the textfile into memory and doing all the manipulation there
    (in an STL container, for example). You need only work with a small
    amount of data (and therefore small files), but imagine that you had so
    many club members that they wouldn't all fit into memory, in which case
    you would not be able to take the STL route anyway.</li>

    <li>You will find it very useful in writing this program to take full
    advantage of as many facilities provided by the <code>utilities</code>
    package as possible, and in particular the various <code>Read*</code>
    free functions. You don't "need" them but you'll find yourself writing
    a lot of code you would not have to write if you <em>did</em> use
    them.</li>

    <li>Study the text items file carefully and note the messages it
    contains, in addition to the program description. These messages are
    all displayed at the appropriate places by the supplied driver,
    <strong>not</strong> by the functions you have to write.</li>

    <li>You must identify yourself in your <code>.cpp</code> file
    containing your functions in the usual way you have to do whenever you
    are supplied with a driver in <code>.obj</code> form. That is, you have
    to place a line like the following (containing <em>your</em>
    information, of course) in the global namespace at the beginning of
    your <code>.cpp</code> file:
      <pre>
extern const string MY_ID_INFO = "Lastname:Firstname:A00123456:csc34201";
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>The file containing your implementations of the required functions
    must be compiled separately and linked to the supplied driver to form
    the final executable that you must submit. If you take the right
    approach to your development, you should be able to use the supplied
    driver as a test driver as you write those functions, without having to
    write your own driver (which is also a possibility, of course). Think
    carefully about how you might do this. You have enough experience at
    this point that you should be able to figure it out.</li>

    <li>You may be wondering why some of our uses of <code>ioFile</code>
    have not been passed by <code>const</code> reference (in
    <code>DisplayAllMembers()</code>, for example), since at that point we
    are just passing in the file for display purposes and not "changing" it
    in any way. However, even moving the read and write "file pointers"
    back and forth over the file referenced by the file variable requires
    that we pass the file variable by reference in the normal way, and not
    by <code>const</code> reference.</li>
