  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>This week you will design and write a program that can evaluate either
  prefix or postfix expressions read in from the command line. Each such
  expression must have positive integer operands and involve only the
  (binary) operators +, -, * and/or /. Some error checking is also required
  on this occasion.</p>

  <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>

  <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>Copy the sample executable <tt>demo_eval_pre_post.exe</tt> and run
    it several times with different (valid) input. Below are several
    suggestions of typical valid examples showing how your program must
    work. Try them (and lots of others of your own choosing) with the
    sample executable:
      <pre>
prompt&gt; demo_eval_pre_post 3 4 5 + *
3 4 5 + * = 27
prompt&gt; demo_eval_pre_post 2 3 * 15 5 7 + / +
2 3 * 15 5 7 + / + = 7
prompt&gt; demo_eval_pre_post / * + 6 2 3 - 9 7
/ * + 6 2 3 - 9 7 = 12
prompt&gt; demo_eval_pre_post + * 2 3 / 15 + 5 7
+ * 2 3 / 15 + 5 7 = 7
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Then, to generate the kinds of errors which the program must
    recognize and report, try the following examples:
      <pre>
prompt&gt; demo_eval_pre_post + * 2 3
prompt&gt; demo_eval_pre_post + x 2 3
prompt&gt; demo_eval_pre_post + * 2 3 4 5
prompt&gt; demo_eval_pre_post 3 3 * 5
prompt&gt; demo_eval_pre_post 2 3 4 + x
prompt&gt; demo_eval_pre_post 2 3 + *
prompt&gt; demo_eval_pre_post 2 3 4 5 6 + *
</pre>You should make up and try a lot more of these kinds of invalid
examples to get a good feel for the error-reporting performed by the
program.
    </li>

    <li>Write pseudocode for a solution of this problem and revise it until
    you are convinced that a program that implements your pseudocode will
    be the one you want.</li>

    <li>Translate your pseudocode into C++ and continue testing your
    program until you are convinced it works correctly.</li>

    <li>Make sure your source code is identified, formatted, and documented
    properly, according to our current rules and guidelines.</li>

    <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
  any)</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>You may find it useful to note that if you are dealing with a
    prefix expression, the first "token" in the input will be an operator,
    while if you are dealing with a postfix expression, the first token
    will be an operand.</li>

    <li>We discussed in class the algorithms for evaluating both prefix and
    postfix arithmetic expressions, so all you have to do to get this
    program to evaluate such expressions is implement those algorithms.
    Thus the interesting part of this submission is making your program
    recognize and report some potential errors. You may do this however you
    like, but here is a very simple exception class that you may place in
    your program and then throw (and catch) appropriate
    <code>Exception</code> objects at the appropriate places in your
    program:
      <pre>
class Exception
{
public:
    Exception(const string&amp; message) {this-&gt;message = message;}
    string getMessage() {return message;}
private:
    string message;
};
</pre>
Note that unlike in Java, in C++ exception classes do not
have to inherit from any particular C++ classes, exception or otherwise.
Also, there is no <code>throws</code> keyword in C++. Among other things,
this means that in C++, functions that may throw an exception but not
catch it themselves are not required to so indicate with a "throws clause"
in the function header.
    </li>
    <li>A good approach to this submission, as is often the case but here
    especially, will be to get both types of evaluation working properly
    before trying to deal with error handling.</li>
  </ol>
