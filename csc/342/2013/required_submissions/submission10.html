  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>This week your task is to design and write a program for creating and
  displaying "small" minimum heaps (15 or fewer nodes). The node values
  will be single characters, and the heap display will be in the form of a
  complete binary tree (the "shape property" for heaps) that also exhibits
  the "order property" for <em>minimum</em> heaps (the value in any node
  precedes (is "less than") any value in each of that node's subtrees).</p>

  <p>The character values for the tree nodes may be input by the user from
  the keyboard, or generated randomly after the user has input the desired
  number of values and the character range from which they are to be drawn.
  For simplicity we deal only with unique character values in our heaps,
  and this means that in menu option 2 the user must enter 15 or fewer
  unique characters and that the randomly generated values in menu option 3
  must also be unique.</p>

  <p>Note that this week you are provided only with a sample executable.
  The entire submission is quite analogous to last week's submission,
  except that this week your binary trees are heaps rather than binary
  search trees. Among other things, this means you can re-use your tree
  display routine (and you have another chance to work on it if there were
  problems with it last week). You can also re-use other pieces of code,
  such as the code for reading in the user's data and the code for
  generating random data.</p>

  <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>

  <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>By now you know the drill ... begin by downloading the demo
    executable and running it a few times. Be sure to exercise all options
    enough times and with enough variety in your input to get a good feel
    for how the program behaves. In particular be sure to confirm that the
    randomly generated values in menu option 3 are always unique and that
    you cannot choose to have more than 15. Also, confirm that in menu option
    2 the user must enter 15 or fewer values, and again those values must
    be unique.</li>

    <li>When you understand what is required, write pseudocode for a
    program to emulate this executable and revise it until you are
    convinced that an implementation of your pseudocode will solve the
    problem.</li>

    <li>Translate your pseudocode into C++ and continue testing your
    program until you are convinced it works correctly.</li>

    <li>Make sure your source code is identified, formatted, and documented
    properly, according to our current rules and guidelines.</li>

    <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
  any)</h3>

  <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>The program does not have a "Get information" menu option, since
    (assuming the user knows what a minimum heap is) the menu options and
    prompts make the program self-explanatory.</li>

    <li>Recall that in our discussion of heaps we used a vector as the
    underlying data structure to hold the heap values. That is, we used a
    sequential binary tree representation rather than the actual tree-like
    representation we employed when discussing (and implementing) both
    expression trees and binary search trees. Note that this program
    displays heaps in actual tree-like form, just as the balanced binary
    search tree program did, so if you choose to re-use your display routine
    from that program here, an interesting part of the current problem may
    be figuring out how to "plug in" your previous display routine to this
    new situation. Ideally you should be able to do this without any
    rewriting of that routine. But (presumably) you will have to have your
    heap in actual tree-like form (using the TreeNode-related structure),
    or convert it to that form, in order to use the previous display
    routine. Just some thoughts, not some instructions ...</li>
    <li>Finally, as for the creating heaps from vectors, feel free to use
    whatever STL facilities are appropriate.</li>
