    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This week you will write a short program that finds <em>anagrams</em>.
    An <em>anagram</em> is a word or phrase formed from the letters in another
    word or phrase. For example, the word <em>slot</em> is an anagram of the
    word <em>lost</em>. We shall only be interested in single-word anagrams,
    and not phrase anagrams.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to have a program to which we can supply as input a single
    word, or a single sequence of characters containing no blanks, but which
    does not have to be an actual word, and the program will then search through
    a dictionary of words to find and display all words that can be formed from
    the letters in the input (in other words, to find and display all anagrams
    of the input).</p>
    <p>Although we will not be dealing with them, here for your amusement are a
    few interesting examples of anagrams that involve more than a single word,
    and in which we have taken occasional liberties with capitalization:</p>
<pre>
    eleven plus two == twelve plus one
    presbyterians == best in prayers == Britney Spears
    desperation == a rope ends it
    the eyes == they see
    the morse code == here come dots
    dormitory == dirty room
    butterfly == flutter by 
    funeral == real fun
    slot machines == cash lost in me
    debit card == bad credit
    vacation time == I am not active
    I run to escape == a persecution
    a gentleman == elegant man
    Christmas tree == search set trim
    television programming == permeating living rooms
    the detectives == detect thieves
    sunshine and shadow == show in sun and shade
    software == swear oft
    sycophant == acts phony
    The Hilton == hint hotel
    New York Times == monkeys write
    George Bush == he bugs Gore
    Tuesday November Third == Many Voted Bush Retired
    Clint Eastwood == Old West Action
    Alec Guinness == genuine class
    David Letterman == nerd amid late TV
    The Public Art Galleries == Large Picture Halls I Bet
    The United States Bureau of Fisheries == I raise the bass to feed us in the future
</pre>    
    <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the sample executable and the accompanying dictionary
      file.</li>
      <li>
        Run the program, enter the name of the dictionary file and then enter
        some words or letter-sequences and have the program search for
        corresponding anagrams. Here are some to try: 
<pre>
      list, last, lost, lust, gardenia, grow, grinch, groan, emanate, drawback,
      bacterial, vacate, glare, hate, mental, leap, leapt, slate, name, mate, edit, 
      item, rinse, stripe, live, stance, tuba, came, care, garden, latucoage
</pre>
        Note that since the word <em>grinch</em>, for example, does not
        appear in the dictionary we get no results at all. The word
        <em>grow</em>, on the other hand, has no anagrams, so all we get back
        when it is the input is the word itself, since it <em>is</em> in the
        dictionary. We could also input the string <em>rogw</em> and get back
        <em>grow</em>, since <em>grow</em> is an anagram of that string. This
        is also illustrated by the last example above, which is not a word.
      </li>
      <li>Continue experimenting until you thoroughly understand the problem
      and the behavior of the program. <em>Note in particular the error message
      output if you enter a bad file name for the dictionary.</em></li>
      <li>Write pseudocode for a solution of this problem and revise it until
      you are convinced that a program that implements your pseudocode will
      be the one you want.</li>
      <li>Translate your pseudocode into C++.</li>
      <li>Continue testing your program until you are convinced it works
      correctly.</li>
      <li>Make a final check to ensure your source code is identified,
      formatted, and documented properly and you have included the
      self-assessment <tt>/* ... */</tt> comment to tell the marker the state
      of your submission.</li>
      <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
    any)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>We said in the Overview above that you would be writing a "short"
      program, and we meant it, in the following sense. Your submitted source
      code file must not exceed a page of code, which in Visual Studio is 66
      lines. If it does, the marker will deduct a point for each line in
      excess of this limit. This limitation is designed to make you think
      seriously about your program design and make maximal use of the STL to
      accomplish whatever tasks need to be done.</li>
      <li>You must include follow the usual style guidelines, with the
      exception that since the program must be on one page you need not use
      blank lines to separate "logical chunks" of your code, or comment your
      code on separate lines. But that means you need to take even more care
      than usual to write readable code, possibly with help of in-line
      comments. You must, however, have the usual self-assessment comment, so
      there is incentive to have a complete and working program so this can
      be short!</li>
      <li>Among the style rules you must follow we mention these in
      particular: one statement per line; and the rule that requires a brace
      to be on a line by itself and line up vertically with its matching
      brace.</li>
      <li>You may write your program under the assumption that both the string
      entered by the user and all dictionary entries are in lower case.</li>
    </ol>
