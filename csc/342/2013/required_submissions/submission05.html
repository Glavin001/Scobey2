  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>This week you will have a chance to hone your "recursion chops" by
  writing a recursive function to compute and display <em>power sets</em>.
  More specifically, you will write two <em>template</em> functions, a
  recursive one to compute a power set, and a non-recursive one to display
  each set in a power set. For the submission you will be working with sets
  and power sets of integers, but you will be writing template functions
  that can work with sets of other elements as well (sets of characters,
  for example).</p>

  <p>The <em>power set</em> of any set is the set of all subsets of that
  set. One can prove (using mathematical induction, and perhaps other
  techniques as well) that the number of sets in the power set of a finite
  set containing n elements is 2^n (2 to the power n). So, for example, the
  power set of any set containing 3 elements will contain 8 elements. If
  this is a new concept for you, construct a set of three elements and then
  write down all of its subsets to confirm the previous statement.</p>

  <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>

  <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>Download the sample executable and run the program a few times to
    see the kind of output you get.</li>

    <li>Next, download the driver file <code>power_set_of_int.cpp</code>
    and study it to see what you are given and what you need to supply, as
    well as the overall structure of the program on this occasion. Note
    that you see the prototypes of two template functions, and it is the
    definitions of these functions that you must write and place in the
    "include file", which is included <em>after</em> <code>main()</code>.</li>

    <li>Design the functions you will need for a solution to this problem,
    and write the ncessary pseudocode for them.</li>

    <li>Revise your solution until you are convinced that the functions
    that implement your pseudocode will be the ones you want.</li>

    <li>Translate your pseudocode into C++ and continue testing your
    program until you are convinced it works correctly.</li>

    <li>When you are finished, make sure your source code file is
    identified, formatted, and documented properly.</li>

    <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
  any)</h3>

  <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>Note that although the driver cautions the user to keep the set
    small to limit the amount of output, your function that computes the
    power set and also your display function should still work fine, whatever
    the size of the set.</li>
    <li>Here is some "recursive pseudocode" that you may find helpful when
    writing your recursive routine to build the power set of a set:
<pre>
if (the set is empty)
    return the empty set
else
    Take an element out of the set and then:
    (1) Find the power set of the "reduced" set
    (2) Add the removed element to each set in the power set of that reduced set
    return the "union" of the two sets in (1) and (2) above
</pre>
</li>
<li>Do not change the driver, except for replacing the generic identification
information with your own in the call to <code>DisplayOpeningScreen()</code>.</li>
