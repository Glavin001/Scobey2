========================================
Program Description

This program allows the user to encrypt the contents of a textfile based on an
easily remembered phrase with which the user is familiar, and which that user
is unlikely to forget. The program can also decrypt such a file, but the phrase
used to encrypt the file must be supplied at the time of decrypting as well.

The encryption scheme used is a straightforward "substitution cipher". That is,
each line of the encoded message contains exactly the same number of characters
as the corresponding line in the original plain text, and once you have decoded
each character of the encoded message you immediately have the original plain
text. This also implies that blank lines in the plain text are preserved in the
encrypted text, which is in fact the case.

The original plain text of any message may contain any or all of the printable
characters in the Standard ASCII Character Set. That is, the original textfile
may contain any or all of those characters with numerical codes from 32 (the
blank space) through to 126 (the tilde, or '~', character).

The phrase to be used for both encrypting and decrypting is obtained from the
user, either from the keyboard or from a file whose name is entered by the
user, after which this is what happens:

1. First, all duplicate characters are removed from this phrase.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2. Second, the remaining (unique) characters (from the phrase) are placed
   in their natural ASCII order, and then reversed. Or, I suppose, you could
   simply say that they are placed in the reverse order of their natural ASCII
   order.

3. Third, the remaining (missing) characters from the complete set of printable
   ASCII characters are added to the end of this list of characters, in their
   natural ASCII order.

4. The now-complete list of printable ASCII characters (in some order) is
   reversed one final time.

This process results in a list containing all printable ASCII characters in
some order. Let's call the resulting list of characters "the key".

If you now imagine a line consisting of all the printable ASCII characters
in their natural order placed underneath the above line (that is, underneath
"the key"), then the encryption of each character in a message of plain text
would be performed by finding the character to be encrypted in the bottom line
and using whatever character lies immediately above it in "the key" as the
corresponding encrypted character.


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Similarly, when decoding any given character, you would find the encrypted
character in the top line (that is, in "the key"), and then the character
immediately below it would be the corresponding plain text character.

The phrase required for encryption (or decryption) may be entered from the
keyboard at the time of encryption (or decryption), but since such a phrase
may be quite long, it may also be placed in a single-line textfile and read
in from that file. The user has the choice whenever such a phrase is required.
