  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>This week you will design and write a program that allows the user to
  create and display balanced binary search trees of characters. Since we
  are specifying the type, we are not going to use a template BST class. In
  fact, we are not using a BST class at all, just old-fashioned free
  functions to do all the work. You will have enough to keep you busy,
  probably, without dealing with templates or even "ordinary" class
  infrastructure.</p>

  <p>We shall only deal with "small" trees (height 3 or less, and therefore
  15 nodes or fewer).</p>

  <p>Users may enter their own character values, or generate them randomly.
  The values are first placed into a vector, from which the balanced binary
  search tree may be generated.</p>

  <p>The tree is displayed as an actual tree shape.</p>

  <p>In the past you have often been given a <code>.h</code> specification
  file and been required to implement the specifications in that file. This
  time you are given much more freedom ... to first decide what functions
  you need, then to put their specifications in your own header file
  (<code>balanced_bst.h</code>), and their implementations in a
  separately-compilable implemenation file
  (<code>balanced_bst.cpp</code>).</p>

  <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Copy the sample executable and run it. Notice there is no "Get
    information" option, since none is really needed. The menu options
    themselves, together with the discussion in this document, give you all
    you need to know.</li>

    <li>When you understand what is required, write pseudocode for a
    program to emulate this executable and revise it until you are
    convinced that an implementation of your pseudocode will solve the
    problem.</li>

    <li>Translate your pseudocode into C++ and continue testing your
    program until you are convinced it works correctly.</li>

    <li>Make sure all of your source code files are identified, formatted,
    and documented properly, according to our current rules and
    guidelines.</li>

    <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
  any)</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>The shell file is a "starter file" that you can use and fill in the
    required code. It will save you some "busy work".</li>

    <li>You must use the usual struct as the basis for your tree (this
    should be placed in your header file):
      <pre xml:space="preserve">
struct TreeNode
{
    TreeNode* leftPtr;
    char      data;
    TreeNode* rightPtr;
};
</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
