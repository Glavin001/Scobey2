Use of Blackboard in CSCI 2342
</p>

<p>
Blackboard is a course delivery system that
we will employ mainly for making the marks you receive
in the course available on-line. It has other facilities
which we may utilize if there is a need or a demand for
them.
</p>
<p>
To access Blackboard you need to go to
<a target="_blank" href="http://smuport.smu.ca">SMUport link</a> on the
SMU home page, log in with your "s number", and click on
the "My Courses" link. This should take you to a page
listing the courses you are taking, and if you then 
click on the link for CSCI 2342 you should be able to 
access your marks, as well as any other facilities that
have been made available.
