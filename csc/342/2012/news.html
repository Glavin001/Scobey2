    <li>In case anyone is wondering, I have not yet solved the mystery
    of what was wrong with the last sample program I tried to compile
    and run in class on Monday. In fact, it's an even bigger mystery
    now, since it works fine on my office computer, but if I copy all
    of the files involved (including the utilities.obj) that work fine
    in my office, they do not work fine (or at all) on the campus
    desktop. In addition, the files as far back as Submission 01, which
    worked fine at the time, no longer work. They too, you will recall,
    used the random generator (and therefore also the clock_t and other things
    that now seem to be a problem). This seems to point to some kind of
    problem with Visual Studio on the campus desktop, but I didn't think
    any updates were made during the term. So, if anyone can download
    the time.h, time.cpp, zonetime.h, zonetime.cpp and timevector.cpp
    files and get them to compile and run with your already downloaded utilities.h/utilities.obj
    I would really like to know about it. That would really point to a
    campus desktop problem.</li>

    <li>Just a reminder that your info sheet, should you choose
    to prepare one for use during the final exam, is due in hard
    copy form at my office (MN 126) no later than noon on Wednesday, 
    April 4, 2012. See below for further details.</li>

    <li>The demo executable for Submissions 09 and 10 has
    been updated slightly as of Sun Mar 18 18:32:59 ADT 2012
    to take account of poor wording in the 
    report that all items have been read into the binary
    search tree in option 3. [Thanks to Evan Lowry for 
    pointing this out.]</li>

      You will be permitted to have with you, during the final exam in CSCI 2342,
      a sheet of paper, up to legal size (8 and 1/2 inches by 14 inches),
      containing whatever information you think may be helpful to you.
      There are no limitations on content or font size. There are,
      however, some conditions:
      <ul class="hardleft">
      <li>You must have your name in the upper right corner of at least
      one side of the sheet, so that I may hand it out to you at the
      beginning of the exam period. If you want to work on the preparation
      of such a sheet with one or more other students in the class, that's
      fine. In other words, two or more people may submit identical sheets.</li>
      <li>You must prepare the hard copy of your sheet and hand it in to me
      no later than noon on Wednesday, April 4. I will not accept any sheets
      after that time, and will not accept any by email. If I am not around
      when you come by my office (MN126) to drop it off, please slide it 
      under the door. I will maintain on the What's New page a list of those
      from whom I've received a sheet. You can look there for confirmation
      that I have your sheet.</li>
      <li>This is an "optional requirement". You are not <em>required</em>
      to prepare such a sheet.</li>

    You may be interested in the following opportunity:
    <pre>
    Dear undergraduate students,
    
    PhD student Donald Morrison is conducting a study entitled "Working 
    Memory Load's Impact on Program Comprehension."  This study is designed 
    to look at how programmers understand programs.
    
    He is looking for up to 40 participants who are fluent in English, over 
    the age of 18 and either enrolled in an undergraduate program in 
    Computer Science or with equivalent programming experience. Participants 
    should be familiar with either Java or C#.
    
    Session will take approximately 60 minutes and will take place at a
    location of your choosing, and will be scheduled at your convenience. 
    Fifteen dollars compensation will be available to participants.  The 
    session itself will involve answering questions about and modifying a 
    few relatively simple programs.
    
    Any time from 9:30am on is available.
    
    Interested?  Contact Donald Morrison (morrison@cs.dal.ca).
    
    Thanks,
    
    Donald Morrison, PhD Student
    Faculty of Computer Science
    Dalhousie University
    Halifax, NS

    <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>As of Tue Feb 21 12:36:22 AST 2012 I have added a third item
    to "Additional Notes ... " for Submission 06 as a reminder of the
    "viewpoint" you should maintain when running the sample executable.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>2012.02.16</p>
    <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>A revised executable for Submission 06 has been uploaded
    as of Thu Feb 16 16:56:31 AST 2012, removing the redundancy
    of using both "number" and "#" to report file position that
    we noted in class on Monday last.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>2012.02.03</p>
    <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>Re Submissions 04/05, note that if you already have some
    "packet files" in your directory when you start a run, at least
    some previously created packet files will likely be overwritten
    and you will wind up with a mixed-up bunch of packet files that
    cannot be reassembled after a new run, so you should always
    start a new run with a "clean" directory (no packet files in it).
    Also note that though the "theoretical" message-size limit is 5000
    "words" for your packet files (1000 files with five words
    each), a more practical and "safer" limit is 1000 words,
    since (again "theoretically") each packet file might
    only contain a single word (however unlikely this might
    be). [Thanks to Evan Lowry for some comments leading to
    these comments of mine.]</li>
    </ol>
    <p>2012.01.19</p>
    <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>Thanks to Evan Lowry for pointing out the following two
    problems with Submission 02 (and they would also have appeared in
    Submission 03, but they have been rectified and new executables
    have been installed for both Submissions, as of Thu Jan 19 13:46:21 AST 2012):
    <ul>
    <li>If you entered the name of a file that didn't exist
    when reading in an island, then after you got the message 
    about the file not existing a second message was shown--the same message
    that you got if you tried to do something with an island that
    didn't exist. That was at best a redundant, and at worst a
    possibly confusing, message and it has been eliminated.
    Bottom line: Now you go directly back to the menu after 
    getting the message that the file does not exist.</li>
    <li>Second, if you already had an island read in and
    tried to read in a new one, the current island was wiped
    out whether you succeeded in reading in a new one or not.
    Now, if the the new file doesn't exist, you retain the
    old island.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>2012.01.12</p>
    <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>I have made three small changes affecting the code.h and score.h
    files. They are "small" in the sense that they do affect their use,
    but you may wish to download the revised/improved versions. The
    "problem" was that in three instances of member function headers
    I had included either Score:: or Code:: before the name of the
    function. This is required in the .cpp implementation file, of course,
    but is at best superfluous in the .h file. So ... the changes simply
    involved the removal of same. Bottom line ... whether you use the
    revised or the orginal versions will not matter, at least when using 
    Visual C++. [Thanks to Evan Lowry for bringing these inconsistencies
    to my attention.]</li>
    </ol>
    <p>2012.01.10</p>
    <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>In Submission 01 <tt>operator&lt;</tt> was not implemented
    properly in the <tt>Code</tt> class.  The problem has been fixed
    as of Tue Jan 10 17:36:41 AST 2012, and you should download new
    copies of <tt>code.obj</tt> and the demo executable
    if you downloaded them before the above date and time.
    [Thanks to William Wells for bringing this to my attention.]

    </ol>
    <p>2012.01.04</p>
    <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>Recall that in class today I suggested you may need to
    <tt>#include &lt;iterator&gt;</tt> into the stream iterator sample program
    to get it to compile under VS2010. Thanks to William Wells
    for confirming that this is in fact the case.</li>

    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>Email restrictions on CSC342?? accounts
      <br />
       The CSC342?? accounts can send e-mail, but traditionally have not
      been able to receive it. In any case, it is probably not a good idea
      to send from your CSC342?? account any e-mail to which you expect a
      reply. Use your personal account for e-mail instead, and be sure to
      identify yourself by signing your name, or you may not get a
      reply.</li>
      <li>
        Don't confuse these three (very different) things: 
        <ul class="hardleft">
          <li>Your personal Saint Mary's account (s???????), and its
          password, which you also use to access your MyCourses link when
          you log in to SMUport, which is where you will find your marks on
          the weekly submissions and your mid-term mark.</li>
          <li>Your course account (CSC342??) for this course, and its
          password, which you will receive in the second class. You must
          use this account for all work in the course when you are on
          campus, since your personal account will not have the required
          setting for some actions.</li>
          <li>
            Your username and password for the protected part of the web
            site for this course. 
            <p><b>Initially <em>both</em> your username <em>and</em> your
            password for the course web site are your SMU ID number:
            A00??????.</b></p>
            Your username for this site will remain your A number, but you
            must change your password when you log in.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If you do not have an account on "the cs machine" (our department's
      Linux server) you should see our technician Andrew Valencik in MN118 to obtain
      one, since we will likely be discussing something called Subversion at
      some point this term, and for which you will want such an account. You
      should get familiar with Linux in any case, and having such an account
      is a good start.</li>
