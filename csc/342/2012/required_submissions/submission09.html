    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This week you will begin a two-part implementation of an
    ADTBinarySearchTree class for storing character data. We discussed in
    class the implementation of a template class for the binary search tree,
    but your implementation will not be a template class. This will make the
    implementation simpler, but there will still be plenty to do, and the
    main goal is to make you familiar with binary search trees and operations
    on them, rather than give you more C++ template programming practice.</p>
    <p>For brevity you will name the class <tt>BSTChar</tt>. A driver is
    supplied, as well as a shell file (<tt>BSTChar_globals_shell.hpp</tt>)
    containing a couple of "busy work" functions (for building the menu and
    displaying the program information), as well as prototypes for the
    high-level functions that deal with user interaction. You will fill in
    the bodies of these high-level prototypes to complete their definitions,
    and, of course, design and write the <tt>BSTChar</tt> class in the usual
    form of a separately compiled <tt>.h/.cpp</tt> file pair.</p>
    <p>You already have some code that you can adapt for use from the sample
    programs illustrating binary search trees. Much of the remaining code
    (for this Part 1 and also for Part 2) you have available in pseudocode
    form from the on-line notes.</p>
    <p>The approach in this last two-part submission for the term differs
    somewhat from previous two-part efforts. You must complete the project by
    the end of the two weeks, but <em>you</em> get to decide how much and
    which parts you will complete the first week. Also, the marker can be
    brutally frank at the end of the first week in his comments about about
    what you need to do by the end of the second week. This is a double-edged
    sword, since you could conceivably do nothing the first week and still
    get a perfect mark. (However, you probably won't be able to do nothing,
    or almost nothing, the first week and finish the project.) It would be
    much smarter to do as much as you can the first week, so you have less to
    do the second week and can fine tune what you have already done. I'll be
    interested to see how people handle this extra bit of "freedom" in
    submission preparation.</p>
		<p><b>In any case, whatever mark you get on the second
		week's submission, when the project should be complete, will apply to
		both weeks. So, the same mark will be recorded for each week on
		Blackboard.</b></p>
    <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>Copy all of the sample files.</li>
      <li>Run the sample executable (which is the complete program, so it
      is not numbered) and try all of the menu options enough
      times to get a good feel for how the program behaves.</li>
      <li>Give some thought to the order in which you will implement the
      various things that need implementing.</li>
      <li>Design your class.</li>
      <li>Write pseudocode for all the global functions for which you have
      been given the prototypes, as well as all member functions and any
      helper functions, for your class. Revise your pseudocode until you are
      convinced that a class that implements your pseudocode will be the one
      you want.</li>
      <li>Decide in what sequence you want to "plug in" and test your
      code.</li>
      <li>Continue testing until the chosen part of the class for this week
      is complete and you are convinced everything works correctly.</li>
      <li>Make sure your source code is identified, formatted, and documented
      properly, according to our current guidelines.</li>
      <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
    any)</h3>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>
        Since you get to choose which parts of the submission you are going
        to implement this week, these are the changes you will need to make
        in the driver file <tt>BSTChar_main.cpp</tt>: 
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Replace the question marks in the opening comments to 
          reflect the current submission. [Do this for the shell file
          as well, after your copy has been renamed appropriately.]</li>
          <li>The ID info must be changed to be <em>your</em> ID info.</li>
          <li>The menu options that have not been implemented this week
          should have their function calls commented out and replaced by a
          single statement which is a call to the <tt>Pause()</tt> function
          that reports, "This menu option is not yet implemented." This
          means, of course, that you will not be implementing the
          corresponding global function and class member functions this
          week.</li>
          <li>The call to <tt>Pause()</tt> after the <tt>switch</tt>
          statement in <tt>main()</tt> will then have to be "guarded" to
          avoid having two back-to-back pauses for those non-implemented
          options.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>A high-level goal this week should be to complete the
      design of your class, roughly half of the implementation,
      along with the corresponding user-interaction global functions.
      The tree display might be the most time-consuming part, so
      you should begin thinking about that this week as well. You
      can, however, simply output the values anyway you like to
      confirm that you have the tree you think you have--the display doesn't
      have to look "tree-like" this week, but there does, obviously, need
      to be some sort of display so the marker can tell whether you 
      have a tree or not.</li>
      <li><font color="red">Be sure that your self-assessment this week
      includes a description/list of which parts you have completed so
      the marker knows what to look for.</font></li>
    </ol>
