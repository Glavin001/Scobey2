    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This week your task is to gain a reasonable comfort level working
    with binary files, and in particular the "random access" aspect of
    working with binary files. To do that you will write a menu-driven
    program that allows the user to create a binary file of real numbers and
    then read from and/or write to that file at various locations within the
    file. The program also permits the user to display a "status report"
    after any particular operation.</p>
    <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>Download the sample executable and spend some time "putting it
      through its paces". Be sure to display the "status report" frequently
      and reconcile what you have just done with the given output.</li>
      <li>Now download the supplied <tt>.hpp</tt> file and note the two
      functions it contains. Having these functions will save you some
      "busy work". Use this file as a <tt>#include</tt> file.</li>
      <li>When you feel comfortable that you understand all aspects of what
      the program is doing, write pseudocode to describe the program's
      behavior.</li>
      <li>Translate your pseudocode (incrementally) into C++ and test
      (incrementally) until you have the complete program working in the
      same way as the sample executable.</li>
      <li>When you are finished, make sure your source code file is
      identified, formatted, and documented properly.</li>
      <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
    any)</h3>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>This week, perhaps for the first and last time ever, you are
      permitted to write your program as a single (large) main function. It
      will be essentially a single <tt>do...while</tt> loop containing a
      fairly large <tt>switch</tt> statement to handle all the menu
      options. By not requiring you to break up <tt>main()</tt> into
      several smaller functions we let you put all your time into dealing
      with binary file matters.</li>
      <li>
        For your information, the prompts and messages that appear during
        the execution of various menu options are listed below. Many of
        them are "pause" messages, but the "Press Enter to continue ... "
        prompt is not shown. 
<pre>
Option 1:
---------
Program now terminating.

Option 3:
---------
Enter name of new file:
-----------------------
File name.ext has been created and left open for reading and writing.
Be sure to close this file before creating or opening another file.

Option 4:
---------
Enter name of already existing file:
------------------------------------
File name.ext has been opened for reading and writing.
Be sure to close this file before opening or creating another file.

Option 5:
---------
File status:

Option 6:
---------
Move to the beginning, the end, or a particular "middle" position?
Any requested position should make sense, relative to what's in the file.
Or, move to a (sensible) position relative to your current position?
Enter b, m, e or r:
-------------------
You are now positioned at the beginning of the file.
----------------------------------------------------
You are now positioned at the end of the file.
----------------------------------------------
There are ? integers in the file.
Enter number of the integer at which you want to be positioned:
...
You are now positioned at number #?.
If you read or write now, this real will be read or overwritten.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter number of positions to move (+ forward, - backward):
...
You are now positioned ? positions after [or before] your previous position.

Option 7:
---------
Enter real values here:
--------------------------
The value ? has been written to the file.
-----------------------------------------

Option 8:
---------
How many reals do you want to read?

Option 9:
---------
Contents of file name.ext:
--------------------------
All values in the file have been read and displayed.

Option 10:
---------
Display all values from current location on?
--------------------------
OK ... then how many values?
--------------------------
Here are the requested values:
--------------------------
All the requested values have been read and displayed.

Option 11:
----------
File name.ext has been closed.
</pre>
      </li>
			<li>Keep in mind when you are running the sample executable that you
			need to keep a mental note of "where you are in the file" and you 
			should not choose another menu option to do something that doesn't
			make sense to do from the point where you are in the file (displaying
			more values if you're already at the end of the file, for example).
			You need to do this because the program does not do any of that kind
			of checking for you.</li>
