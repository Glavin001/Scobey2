    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This week our overview is simplicity itself ... you will be
    completing the project begun last week.</p>
    <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>Finish the design of your class, if you have not done so already.</li>
      <li>Complete the pseudocode for any remaining global functions for which you have
      been given the prototypes, as well as all remaining member functions and their
      helper functions, if required. Revise your pseudocode until you are
      convinced that its implementation will do the job.</li>
      <li>Decide in what sequence you want to "plug in" and test your
      remaining code.</li>
      <li>Continue testing until the class is complete and you are convinced
      everything works correctly.</li>
      <li>Make sure your source code is identified, formatted, and documented
      properly, according to our current guidelines.</li>
      <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
    any)</h3>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>Be sure to make a final check that all the comments and the ID
      info in each file show this week's submission and your identification
      information before submitting.</li>
    </ol>
