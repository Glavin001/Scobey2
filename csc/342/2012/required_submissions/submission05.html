    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This week your task is to complete the program for dealing with
    "information packets" distributed over a number of "packet files" that
    you began with last week's submission. This means that you will have to
    implement the code behind options 6 and 7 of the menu, the options that
    let a user assemble the message contained in a valid collection of packet
    files, and then display that message.</p>
    <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>Copy the sample executable, <tt>demo_packets2.exe</tt>. The text
      items file from Part 1 (<tt>packets.txt</tt>) is to be used for Part 2
      as well.</li>
      <li>Run the program and note first of all that menu options 6 and 7 are
      now implemented.</li>
      <li>Put the program through all of its paces until you have a good
      sense of how everything works together as whole.</li>
      <li>Write pseudocode for the message-assembly and display routines, and
      revise it until you are convinced that a program that implements your
      pseudocode will be the one you want.</li>
      <li>Translate your pseudocode into C++ and continue testing your
      program until you are convinced it works correctly.</li>
      <li>As you did for the previous submission, divide your code into two
      files, this time <tt>packets2.cpp</tt> and <tt>packets2.hpp</tt>. In
      <tt>packets2.cpp</tt> put your <tt>main()</tt> driver function and a
      function to build your menu, but put every thing else, i.e., everything
      having to do with the packets, in the "include file"
      <tt>packets2.hpp</tt>, and <tt>#include</tt> that file into your
      <tt>packets2.cpp</tt>.</li>
      <li>Make sure both source code files are identified, formatted, and
      documented properly, using doxygen documentation and/or regular C++
      comments as appropriate.</li>
      <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
    any)</h3>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>What about testing this time? As always, you will want to do
      standalone testing of your program. Now that you have a complete
      program of your own, that means making sure that it can perform all of
      the required actions correctly: creating packet files from a message
      file, re-assembling the message from the packet files, showing all the
      packet files, deleting all the packet files, and displaying the
      re-assembled message. But also, the packets in any group of packet
      files created by your program from a message file should be able to be
      re-assembled into the original message (except probably for formatting)
      by the sample executable. And, conversely, the packets in any group of
      packet files created from a message file by your program should be able
      to be re-assembled into the original message (except probably for
      formatting) by your program. Your testing should involve several
      instances of both of these scenarios.</li>
      <li>As we pointed out in the notes at the end of the previous
      submission, you need to take note of what happens with
      <tt>packets2.exe</tt> if you happen to choose either option 6 when
      there are no packet files or option 7 when there is no message to
      display. The behavior of the program can be classified as "trivially
      correct". If there are no packet files when you choose option 6, it
      still says that the message has been assembled from the packet files.
      This is "trivially true" since there are no packet files and therefore
      no message. Similarly, if you ask to display the message when there is
      none, there will be a display in the usual format, but the place where
      the message would normally appear will be an empty line. Depending on
      how you implement things in general, these behaviors may be easier to
      implement than the alternative of going to the trouble of checking for
      packet files, reporting that there are none, and thus that a message
      cannot be assembled. Similarly, the program could report that there is
      no message if asked to display one when none exists, but it may be
      simpler just to display an empty message. In any case, now that you are
      implementing these two options, you can choose to emulate the sample
      executable behavior or have your program provide appropriate warnings
      when the user chooses either of these menu options "prematurely",
      whichever you find easier.</li>
      <li>No global variables are necessary, or even convenient, so none
      are permitted.</li>
