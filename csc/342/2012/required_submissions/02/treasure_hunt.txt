Program Description

This program concerns itself with searching for hidden treasure on remote
islands of the South Pacific. The islands are not particularly hospitable
places and offer many obstacles to treasure seekers, so there may or may
not be a path to the treasure on a particular island, and whether there is
or is not a path may depend on where the search is started. But ... if there
is in fact a path, this program will find it.

Options 1 and 2 of the Menu are the usual "Quit" and "Get info" choices.

Option 3 allows the user to read in an "island configuration" from an external
textfile. Such a configuration is a rectangle of characters with a border of
* characters, blank spaces to indicate paths along which a treasure seeker may
search, and H characters to indicate no-go zones.

Option 4 allows the user to display the current cofiguration at any time.
Depending on what has happened in the meantime, this display may show any
of the following:
1. The original island configuration
2. A configuration that has had its original state modified by user input
3. A configuration that shows the result of a successful search by marking
   the path with a sequence of 'O' characters and also marking dead-end
   locations (that were examined in the process of finding the successful
   path) with 'X' characters
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4. A configuration that shows the result of an unsuccessful search by marking
   with an 'X' character all dead-end locations that were examined in the
   process of trying to find a path to the treasure
   
Option 5 allows the user to modify the current island configuration by
changing one character at a time in that configuration. (Perhaps the original
map was at fault and needs to be updated as the result of information brought
back by scouting parties sent out after arrival on the island.)

Option 6 allows the island configuration to be reset to its original state at
any time (possibly after some modifications if the scouting party brought back
faulty information after all, or even after a full search has been conducted).

Option 7 allows the user to have the program conduct a search based on the
current island configuration, starting from any valid location, and with or
without the tracing feature turned on.
