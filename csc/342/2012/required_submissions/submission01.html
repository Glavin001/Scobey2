  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>Many computing science students express a desire to become a "game
  programmer". Not all such students fully realize what is involved. First,
  you should have a good grounding in mathematics as well as programming.
  Second, you should realize that it may not be as "glamorous" as you might
  have thought. For one thing, the vast majority of games fail in the
  market place, and game programmers are not necessarily the best paid
  software developers. Furthermore, should you in fact become a game
  programmer, it is entirely possible you will spend most of your time
  "gluing together" pieces of software that other people have written,
  rather than developing anything "from scratch". None of this is meant to
  discourage you ... just to inject a touch of reality.</p>

  <p>And, speaking of "gluing together" some pieces of code, that is what
  this assignment involves. The task requires you to write a driver program
  that "glues together" objects of two provided classes, a <tt>Code</tt>
  class and a <tt>Score</tt> class, to produce a simple "game" in which the
  computer guesses a "secret code" chosen by the user. So, not a
  knock-down-drag-'em-out game in which the pieces are a game "engine", an
  AI (artificial intelligence) module, avatars in high-definition graphics,
  and the like; just an old-fashioned text-based game requiring some
  old-fashioned logical thinking and garden variety programming. Oh, well
  ...</p>

  <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>

  <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>Download the sample executable and its accompanying text items file
    and run the program a few times. Be sure to check out the "on-line
    help" provided by the program and make the program guess your code a
    few times, with and without your providing a starting guess.</li>

    <li>Study the doxygen documentation of the <tt>Code</tt> and
    <tt>Score</tt> classes, as well as the <tt>code.h</tt> and
    <tt>score.h</tt> files themselves.</li>

    <li>Design first, then (and <em>on</em>ly then) write a C++ driver
    program that will emulate as closely as possible the behavior of the
    sample executable, except that the opening screen will contain your own
    ID information. You will, of course, have to include the
    <tt>utilities.h</tt>, <tt>score.h</tt> and <tt>code.h</tt> files into
    your driver, and link to <tt>utilities.obj</tt>, <tt>score.obj</tt> and
    <tt>code.obj</tt> to form your final executable.</li>

    <li>When the program is working correctly, make a final check before
    submission to ensure your source code is identified, formatted, and
    documented properly. We will discuss what proper identification and
    documentation means in class and lab, but there are also menu links on
    the course home page that provide guidelines for submission, program
    identification, source code documentation, C++ coding style and other
    good general programming practices.</li>

    <li>Be sure as well that you have completed the self-assessment comment
    of your submission to inform the marker either that everything is
    complete and working according to the specifications, or to inform the
    marker what is still missing or not working properly in your
    submission.</li>

    <li>This week, and from now on, you must make sure that each of your
    submissions follows all of the required rules and guidelines, which we
    have emphasized in class, and which you should by now have read about
    (at least once) on the course web site.</li>

    <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web, by following the
    appropriate link on the course home page. Note that you need to "sign
    up" for the course on the course's web site before you can make a
    submission.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
  any)</h3>

  <ol class="hardleft">
    <li>This program contains a bit of an "Easter egg": The default maximum
    number of guesses the program is allowed for guessing the user's secret
    code is 10, but you can alter this number by entering a different
    (positive integer) value as the first parameter on the command line.
    There is no error checking on this value, so no telling what will
    happen if what you enter is not a positive integer. You do not have to
    implement this feature, but you can if you like (it's a one-liner). The
    only reason it's there is to allow you to experiment with the program
    and actually get to see all the messages that the program is capable of
    displaying. Without this feature, and with a default maximum number of
    guesses equal to 10, you might never get to see the message displayed
    when the program runs out of guesses.</li>

    <li>Don't worry about any warning like the following when you are
    linking to code.obj and score.obj:
      <pre>
vc100.pdb is missing debugging information for referencing module:
    linking object as if no debug info
</pre>
    </li>
		<li>You can use whatever algorithm you can think of for having the
		computer guess the user's secret code. However, here is a brief 
		description of the one used by the demo executable. First, the program
		starts with either a user-supplied guess, or a randomly generated one.
		It keeps track of all guesses and their corresponding scores. Now 
		suppose it faces the question of whether to offer a new code as a 
		potential solution. What it needs to do is score this new code against
		each of the preceding guesses. Unless the scores obtained when doing
		this match (in each case) the scores obtained when those guesses were
		scored against the secret code, this new code cannot possibly be the
		secret code and hence should not be offered as a potential solution.
		So, when seeking another guess, the program should simply move through
		the set of all codes, making these checks as it goes, and offering as
		the next guess the first code that passes all checks.</li>
