    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This week you will design and write a program that can evaluate
    either prefix or postfix expressions read in from the command line.
    Each such expression must have positive integer operands and involve
    only the (binary) operators +, -, * and/or /. No error checking is
    required on this occasion. If the input is neither a valid postfix
    expression nor a valid prefix expression, the program is simply not
    responsible for what happens, if anything.</p>
    <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>
        Copy the sample executable <tt>demo_evalprepost.exe</tt> and run it several
        times with different input. Below are several suggestions of
        typical examples showing how your program must work. Try them (and
        lots of others of your own choosing) with the sample executable: 
<pre>
prompt&gt; demo_eval_pre_post 3 4 5 + *
3 4 5 + * = 27
prompt&gt; demo_eval_pre_post 2 3 * 15 5 7 + / +
2 3 * 15 5 7 + / + = 7
prompt&gt; demo_eval_pre_post / * + 6 2 3 - 9 7
/ * + 6 2 3 - 9 7 = 12
prompt&gt; demo_eval_pre_post + * 2 3 / 15 + 5 7
+ * 2 3 / 15 + 5 7 = 7
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Write pseudocode for a solution of this problem and revise it
      until you are convinced that a program that implements your
      pseudocode will be the one you want.</li>
      <li>Translate your pseudocode into C++ and continue testing your
      program until you are convinced it works correctly.</li>
      <li>Make sure your source code is identified, formatted, and
      documented properly, according to our current rules and
      guidelines.</li>
      <li>Finally, submit the required files over the web.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
    any)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>You may find it useful to note that if you are dealing with
      a prefix expression, the first "token" in the input will be an
      operator, while if you are dealing with a postfix expression,
      the first token will be an operand.</li>
    </ol>
