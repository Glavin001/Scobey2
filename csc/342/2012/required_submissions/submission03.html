    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This week your task is to complete the backtracking program by
    implementing the code behind option 7 on the menu in the program from
    Part 1. Since we presented a full discussion of the problem in the Part 1
    submission description, we will not repeat any of that discussion
    here.</p>
    <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>Give careful thought to your recursive backtracking solution for
      this searching problem, then write out its pseudocode and revise it
      until you are convinced that a program that implements your pseudocode
      will be the one you want. If you need more convincing of the fact that
      "the sooner you start to type, the longer it will take", you might get
      it on this one.</li>
      <li>Translate your pseudocode into C++, then "plug it into" your
      working infrastructure program from Part 1 and continue testing your
      now-complete program until you are convinced it works correctly.</li>
      <li>Make sure your source code is identified, formatted, and documented
      properly, using doxygen documentation and/or regular C++ comments as
      appropriate.</li>
      <li>Finally, make sure your self-assessment of your submission is
      complete, and then submit the required files over the web.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
    any)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You are permitted to use, and should use, the two global variables 
        <ul class="hardleft">
          <li><tt>tracingOn</tt></li>
          <li><tt>pauseOn</tt></li>
        </ul>
        so that the user can switch on the tracing (with or without pauses)
        each time a search if done, if so desired. The tracing feature must
        of course be implemented as well. Even though the tracing feature is
        only used in the recursive routine, you will get a sense of why it's
        much more convenient to have these "switches" as global variables as
        you develop that routine.<br /><font color="red">But ... you do not 
        need, and must not use, any other global variables.</font>
      </li>
      <li>As for the tracing "reports" that the user sees when the tracing
      feature is switched on, you will probably find it useful to think about
      one or more of the specific C++ features that we discussed last term
      when implementing this part of the code.</li>
      <li>Note that when you are starting from a given location, there
      are four directions in which you may (possibly) go to continue
      your search: north, south, east or west (or equivalently, up, down,
      right or left). For the sake of consistency, let's all agree that
      we will first go right, then down, then left, and finally up.
      That is, we go in the clockwise direction, starting with a movement
      to the right. In other words, we arbitrarily pick that particular
      one of the twenty-four possible orders, which means that all
      traces should follow the same pattern of steps to the treasure,
      or to determine that there is none.</li>
      <li>Note that when the final island configuration is displayed after
      a search, what is shown depends on the result of the search. If the
      seach was successful, the island looks the same as it did at the start,
      except that an 'O' marks every position on the path from the starting
      point to the treasure. That is, even though there may have been dead
      ends encountered before finding a successful path to the treasure, they
      are not shown. On the other hand, if the search was unsuccessful, every
      position along every dead-end path tried is shown marked by an 'X'.</li>
    </ol>
