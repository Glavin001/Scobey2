    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>We are all familiar from personal experiences of one kind or another
    with the idea of heading toward a goal but running into a dead end and
    having to back up and try a new direction. That is the central idea
    behind <em>backtracking</em>, a problem-solving approach that makes
    critical use of recursion, often to solve problems such as finding a path
    through a maze or finding a path from a starting point to a destination
    of some kind. In fact, any problem that can be described in these terms
    is potentially solvable by a backtracking approach.</p>
    <p>So ... this week you will design and write the first phase of a
    two-phase project which will ultimately consist of a program containing a
    recursive routine that makes use of backtracking to find a path, if one
    exists, from a starting point to the location of a hidden treasure. In
    the first phase you will set up the complete infrastructure, but will not
    actually conduct any searches. In the second phase you will implement the
    recursive backtracking search routine.</p>
    <p>The completed first phase will permit the user to read in an island
    configuration from an external textfile, to display that configuration at
    any time, to modify the configuration one position at a time, and to
    reset the configuration to its original state at any point after it has
    been modified.</p>
    <p>This is yet another attempt to help you separate the various issues
    involved in designing a complete solution to a problem, and another
    opportunity for you to practice the avoidance of having to deal with and
    worry about everything at once. On the other hand, as you work on the
    first phase you will need to "think ahead" about what the second phase
    will involve, and try make good choices this time around. For that reason
    we describe the problem and the approach fully here, though you will only
    be doing a partial implementation this week.</p>
    <p>The treasure is hidden on an island, which for some reason always
    happens to be nice and rectangular. Being an island, it is of course
    surrounded by water, and in fact there may or may not be a path from the
    starting point to where the treasure is hidden. Or, there may be more
    than one path. In the latter case, you don't care which path is chosen,
    as long as you find a path to the treasure. This is not a "shortest path"
    problem. In fact, as you will likely discover, which path is chosen from
    among two or more possible paths will depend on how you write your search
    routine.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the three figures shown below. They represent
    three different island configurations. All three of these configurations
    are provided as sample input in the files <tt>island1.txt</tt>,
    <tt>island2.txt</tt> and <tt>island3.txt</tt>, but you should, of course,
    create other, larger, more interesting examples of your own.</p>

</pre>
    <p>In each case the border of the island is represented by the <tt>*</tt>
    characters, and we may not enter or cross this border during a search.
    Thus you can think of the <tt>*</tt> characters as representing the water
    of the surrounding ocean. We will start our search at some valid location
    (represented by a blank space) and we can only move from that blank space
    to another blank space in the horizontal or vertical direction. So ... no
    diagonal movement. And we have to stay on the island until we find a path
    from our starting point to the treasure, or determine that there is no
    such path.</p>
    <p>Let's suppose our starting point is the blank space at the top left
    corner. Then in Figure 1 there is a single direct path from the starting
    point to the treasure location (<tt>@</tt>), given that we can only move
    left or right, or up or down, from a given position. And we can only move
    if the space to which we want to move is open (blank) or contains the goal
    (<tt>@</tt>). In many directions we may be blocked from moving. Positions
    to which we cannot move are represented in these figures by an <tt>H</tt>
    character, perhaps standing for Headhunters, for example, though there
    could be many other reasons why we could not go in a particular
    direction, including high mountains, deep valleys with river gorges,
    swamps full of alligators, and so on. For simplicity, all of these
    terrible possibilities are represented simply by an <tt>H</tt>.</p>
    <p>In Figure 2 there are two possible paths from the starting point to
    the treasure, and in Figure 3 there is no path.</p>
    <p>Your goal will be to write a program that, whatever the size and
    configuration of the island, will find a path from a given starting point
    to the treasure, if one exists, and show that path on the island's
    configuration, marked with a sequence of 'O' characters. Or, your program
    will determine that no path exists, and in this case show what locations
    were examined but led to dead ends and hence no treasure, by marking
    each of these locations with an 'X' character.</p>
    <h3>Steps to Perform</h3>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>First, download the sample executable, not from this week's Part 1,
      but from next week's (complete) Part 2. The text items file is the same
      for both phases, so this week's text items file
      (<tt>treasure_hunt.txt</tt>) applies. Run the program and read the
      program information provided by choosing menu option 2. It will be
      helpful to be familiar with the final goal program even before starting
      the first phase.</li>
      <li>Try reading in each of the sample island configurations, displaying
      each configuration after reading it in, and then performing a number of
      treasure searches on that island, starting from different points on the
      island. Leave the trace feature turned off at this point in your
      experimentation.</li>
      <li>Try modifying each of the sample island configurations to see how
      the outcomes of previous searches on those islands are affected. Try to
      predict what will happen in each case before actually doing it.</li>
      <li>Now try turning the trace on (with and without pauses) for several
      of the configurations and searches you have tried to see how the
      algorithm actually performs the searches.</li>
      <li>Next, download the sample executable from this week's Part 1 and
      run it. Note that the only difference is that the actual search option
      is not implemented. This is what we mean by saying that this week you
      will implement the entire "infrastructure" (but not the searching). But
      ... in the process of implementing that infrastructure you will, as we
      noted above, need to be thinking about how you will do the searching.
      The main decision you have to make in this regard is choosing a
      representation for the island. There are, as is often the case, several
      possibilities. Once you have made this decision, you will have to
      implement all of the non-searching menu options this week, and next
      week the searching option itself, in terms of the structure you have
      chosen. It goes without saying, then, it is not a decision to be taken
      lightly.</li>
      <li>Once you understand what is required, write pseudocode for a
      solution to the problem and revise it until you are convinced that a
      program that implements your pseudocode will be the one you want.</li>
      <li>Translate your pseudocode into C++ and continue testing your
      program until you are convinced it works correctly.</li>
      <li>Make sure your source code is identified, formatted, and documented
      properly, using doxygen documentation and/or regular C++ comments as
      appropriate.</li>
      <li>Finally, make sure your self-assessment of your submission is
      complete, and then submit the required files over the web.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Additional Notes, Requirements, Specifications and/or Hints (if
    any)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Let's say a little more about the searching process as we look for
        treasure on one of our islands.
        <p>First, before we begin an actual search we need to check that we
        are not in some situation where we are essentially finished before we
        start (already at the treasure location, or trying to start from a
        blocked location, for example).</p>
        <p>Then, if we are at a valid starting position (a blank space), our
        location may be on a path that will lead to the treasure. So ... we
        need to mark the current position as part of a potential path (we use
        an 'O' for this purpose) and continue by heading off in one of the
        four possible directions to see if we can find the treasure. We must,
        of course, try all four possible directions before giving up on the
        current position as a possible valid location on a path to the
        treasure.</p>
        <p>If we do give up on the current location, we mark it (using an
        'X') to indicate it is not on any successful path and prevent
        ourselves from reconsidering it an any later attempt. Every time we
        move to a new loation we must repeat this same procedure, which is
        where the recursion comes in. This is the search problem scenario
        that you need to solve by recursive backtracking.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Here is some very high-level pseudocode to govern our behavior
        when we are at a paricular location and evaluating whether or not
        it can be on a successful path to the treasure: 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
if we're actually at the treasure location
    I guess we can quit ... we've found it!
else if we're about to cross the border
    Have to quit ... can't do that
else if we're blocked at this location
    Might as well quit ... this location can't be on a successful path
else if we've already been here
    No point in going that way ... we've previously come from that direction
else
    //Our location is OK, and could be on a successful path, so let's continue searching
    Mark this location with an O since it might be on a successful path
    if we find the treasure by looking in one of the four possible directions from here
        We have a successful search
    else
        We can't find the treasure starting from here
        So ... mark this location with an X so we don't try it again
</pre>
      </li>
