     Notes on the Detail Pages for the STL Container Classes
    <br />
     and Container Adaptor Classes</p>
    <p>Before going to any of the links given below, it may be helpful to
    review the <a href="naming_conventions.html">naming conventions</a>
    used, even though these naming conventions are used to provide names
    whose uses should be self-evident in context. These links lead to
    individual pages for each of the first-class container types
    (<tt>vector</tt>, <tt>deque</tt>, <tt>list</tt>, <tt>map</tt>,
    <tt>multimap</tt>, <tt>set</tt> and <tt>multiset</tt>) as well as
    individual pages for each container adaptor class (<tt>stack</tt>,
    <tt>queue</tt>, and <tt>priority_queue</tt>). Each page provides a
    complete interface, and links to sample programs illustrating the
    various features of that class or adaptor. These sample programs show
    the use of objects of the given type in typical situations. In each
    case, the first group of sample programs tries to illustrate just the
    container(s) under discussion on that page. There may be a second group
    of sample programs whose purpose is to illustrate usage of the given
    container(s) in combination with other STL containers and features.</p>
    <p>Note, however, that each page is a "quick reference", not a
    tutorial. Its goal is to be as useful as possible if you're looking up
    something quickly, or want to see the syntax of something as it would
    be used in an actual program. Thus constructors are shown as they might
    appear in a typical object declaration, and other member functions are
    shown as they might look in a typical function call.</p>
    <p>However, the last section of each page does contain a full list of
    complete prototypes, but the idea is that when you are using one of
    these pages you should only need to refer to that last section as a
    last resort.</p>
    <p>If the brief description of a member function does not explicitly
    mention a return value, that member function may be assumed to have a
    <tt>void</tt> return type. This can, of course, be confirmed by
    checking the prototype section of the page.</p>
