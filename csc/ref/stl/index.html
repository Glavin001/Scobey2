     <p>
     <font color="red"><big>This STL reference site is currently
     (summer, 2006) undergoing major re-design and enhancement to
     achieve a more consistent look and feel, as well as to revise
     the existing sample programs and add some new ones.</big></font>
     </p>
     -->
    <p>This STL reference site is primarily meant for university students
    studying C++ and using the STL, possibly for the first time. <b>A large
    number of sample programs is (are?) already available, including many
    illustrating the member functions in the interface of each container
    and container adaptor, and at least one sample program illustrating
    every STL algorithm, as well as the alternate versions of those
    algorithms that have one.</b> More sample programs will be added as time
    goes on. It is hoped that eventually there will be at least one sample
    program illustrating most anything a typical non-guru STL programmer
    might encounter in reading C++ code, or want to use in his or her own
    programs. Sample programs are generally available in three forms:
    source code, Windows executables (if you trust me enough to run them),
    and text output (from the executables, if you don't trust me enough
    to run them). The text output is exact if the program does not have
    user input, and typical if it is does.</p>
    <p>Each completed or partially complete page is designed to provide
    information on a particular aspect of the C++ Standard Template
    Library. With a topic as complex, as versatile, as powerful, and as
    likely to be enhanced over time as the STL, it is often useful to have
    the same information presented in several different
    ways&mdash;algorithms in alphabetical order, to be sure, but also
    algorithms grouped by purpose, <!--and by the nature of their parameter
                        lists,--> for example. This redundancy, and others,
    will be observed on this site and, with luck, will be found useful.</p>

    <p>This site is likely never to be finished to the author's
    satisfaction, and so is best regarded as a perpetual work-in-progress.
    There may be short or long periods of time during which nothing happens
    on the site, depending on the time and other constraints on the
    author. If you find anything on the site particularly useful, or
    if you can think of a way to make it more useful, or if you find an
    error or some other problem, either trivial or egregious, the author
    would appreciate hearing from you (porter.scobey@smu.ca).</p>
