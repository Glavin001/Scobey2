      group is working on the revision of Microsoft's C++ to better reflect
      the requirements of the C++ Standard.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.cppreference.com/">Nate Kohl's C++ Reference

      section.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/index.html">Standard
      Template Library Programmer's Guide</a> This page from SGI (Silicon
      Graphics) contains a good introduction to the STL, documentation on
      all parts of the "standard" STL, and some additional classes that
      have not yet made it into the STL but likely will in the next round
      of standardization. There is also an "Other STL Resources" link on
      this page that will lead you in a number of interesting
      directions.</li>

    <h3><a id="books" name="books">Books</a></h3>
    <ul class="hardleft">
      <li>Ammeraal, Leen: <em>STL for C++ Programmers</em>, John Wiley
      &amp; Sons, 1997. An older book, and therefore not up to date. In
      fact, it appeared before the 1998 C++ Standard that incorporated the
      STL, but there are lots of examples that illustrate many aspects of
      the STL and are still applicable to the current STL.</li>
      <li>Austern, Matthew A: <em>Generic Programming and the STL</em>,
      Addison Wesley, 1999. This book contains three parts: Introduction to
      Generic Programming, Reference Manual: STL Concepts, and Reference
      Manual: Algorithms and Classes. For whatever reason, I find myself
      referring to this book less often than to any of the others on this
      list, except possibly for (nowadays) Glass and Schuchert.</li>
      <li><a id="primer" name="primer"></a> Glass, Graham and Brett
      Schuchert: <em>The STL &lt;PRIMER&gt;</em>, Prentice Hall PTR, 1996.
      This was one of the first books on the STL. It is therefore now
      seriously out of date, and should not be your first reference on the
      subject. But it was a good read and extremely helpful in its day,
      deserves a place on this list, and can be browsed when you want to
      see how things were in the good ol' days. Also, the "algorithm
      iterface key" used in our <a href="alg_by_purpose.html">STL
      Algorithms Classified by Purpose</a> page is based on the one from
      this text.</li>
      <li>Josuttis, Nicolai: <em>The C++ Standard Library</em>, Addison
      Wesley, 1999. Pretty much anything you want to know about the C++
      Standard Library (including the STL) should be in here somewhere,
      unless what you need happens to be on page 202. If you buy this book,
      make sure that page is not half empty, as it was in my copy.</li>
      <li>Meyers, Scott: <em>Effective STL</em>, Addison Wesley, 2001. The
      third volume in Meyers' excellent "Effective" trilogy gives some good
      and not-found-everywhere advice for using the STL.</li>
      <li>Musser, David R, Gillmer J Derge, and Atul Saini: <em>STL
      Tutorial and Reference Guide, Second Edition</em>, Addison Wesley,
      2001. This text contains both tutorial and reference sections, as
      well as a section in which the authors show how to "solve some simple
      but nontrivial programming problems using STL components". The first
      offer was one of those at the front end of STL development.</li>
      <li>Plauger, PJ, Alexander A Stepanov, Meng Lee and David R Musser:
      <em>The C++ Standard Template Library</em>, Prentice Hall PTR, 2001.
      Here are some names you should recognize. If these guys can't tell
      you what you need to know, you're in big trouble. This book is a
      reference and thus quite technical, and it contains useful (and
      readable) discussions that accompany the presentation of the formal
      details, but it's not really a tutorial for beginners, unless you
      happen to be a very with-it beginner.</li>
      <li>Schildt, Herbert: <em>STL Programming from the Ground Up</em>,
      Osborne/McGraw-Hill, 1999. Of the many STL books now available, and
      with more appearing all the time, this is still one of the better
      ones for quickly looking up what you need to know. It also has a good
      overview of the STL before getting into the details. Schildt has a
      number of other books on C and C++ as well, and all are good sources
      of useful examples and helpful discussion.</li>
