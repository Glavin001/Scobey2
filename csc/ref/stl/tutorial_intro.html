     STL Tutorial Introduction</p>
    <p>Given the complexity and power of the STL (the Standard Template
    Library of C++), and the fact that its use is not exactly intuitive for
    beginners, putting together even a "tutorial introduction" becomes a
    somewhat daunting task right from the get go. Especially if one wants
    to keep it short, as I do.</p>
    <h3>Assumptions</h3>
    <p>So, how shall we proceed? First, we shall assume a couple of
    things:</p>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>You have a reasonable background in basic C++, up to and
      including templates (both classes and functions), since these play a
      key role in the STL. If this is true, you probably have at least
      heard of the STL, though you may not have used it.</li>
      <li>You have read the <a href="faq.html">STL FAQ</a> on this site, so
      that we don't have to repeat that material in detail here.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Thus, you know that the STL has things called <em>containers</em>,
    <em>iterators</em> and <em>algorithms</em>. Our purpose here will be to
    see how these three things come together in what might be called
    "typical STL fashion". Though there is much else to learn about the
    STL, once you have a handle on this, you have made considerable
    progress toward becoming an STL user.</p>
    <h3>Analogies</h3>
    <p>Fortunately, we can begin by drawing some analogies between STL
    containers, iterators and algorithms and things you already know
    about.</p>
    <p>We begin by noting that, at a superficial level at least, any STL
    <em>container</em> is analogous to an <em>array</em>, in that it is
    something that allows you to store and retrieve elements. All STL
    containers are implemented by <em>template</em> classes, which means
    that any given container can easily be used to hold elements of
    virtually any type. So, you have a choice of containers and you can
    choose what kind of values you would like to store in whatever
    container you happen to be using at the time. For example, the STL has
    a container called <tt>vector</tt>, which the most array-like of all
    the STL containers, and in in fact it is often billed as a "better
    array". This is everyone's favorite STL container, and we will use
    it in the examples which follow.</p>
    <p>Your C++ experience will have provided you with an opportunity to
    use <em>pointers</em> to "point at" and manipulate array elements. STL
    <em>iterators</em> are used to "point at" and manipulate STL container
    elements in a manner quite analogous to the way in which pointers are
    used in the array context. But ... each STL container class will have
    its own kind of iterator, one which is most appropriate for that
    particular container. And, in general, STL iterators are much "safer"
    to use than old-fashioned pointers. Interestingly, though, those
    "old-fashioned" pointers can be, and often are, used with STL
    containers in the same way that STL iterators themselves are used,
    bolstering the claim that an STL iterator is, after all, "just a
    generalized pointer to an array".</p>
    <p>And <em>algorithms</em> ... well, you know what they are. Often they
    come in the form of stand-alone or "free" functions which usually take
    in some data via a parameter list and perform some task and/or return
    one or more computed values. And all of this is true of STL algorithms
    as well. But ... where STL algorithms get their additional power and
    flexibility is from the fact that many of their parameters are <em>STL
    iterators</em> rather than STL containers. Since these iterators can
    point at the elements of many different kinds of STL containers this
    means that STL algorithms have a "built-in" ability to deal with a
    variety of containers containing a variety of element types. In other
    words, an algorithm can work on the elements of a container without
    knowing or caring what kind of container it is.</p>
    <h3>Pushing the analogies further with some specific (<tt>vector</tt>)
    examples</h3>
    <p>And now, let's cut to the chase. Consider the line of C++ code</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
vector&lt;int&gt; v(10);
</pre>
    <p>which declares a "vector of integers" of size 10, i.e. a place to
    store 10 values of type <tt>int</tt>. To include such a declaration in
    your program you would also need the following compiler include
    directive:</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
#include &lt;vector&gt;
</pre>
    <p>The above declaration of <tt>v</tt> is somewhat analogous to the
    line of code</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
int a[10];
</pre>
    <p>which declares an ordinary C++ "array of integers" of size 10, also
    a place to store 10 values of type <tt>int</tt>. So ... what's the
    difference, and why the big fuss about vectors? Well ... consider the
    following points:</p>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>
        <big>Index type</big> First, the elements of <tt>v</tt> are
        <tt>v[0]</tt>, <tt>v[1]</tt>, ... <tt>v[9]</tt>, just as the
        elements of <tt>a</tt> are <tt>a[0]</tt>, <tt>a[1]</tt>, ...
        <tt>a[9]</tt>, and both are used in the same way. But even here
        there is a "hidden" and potentially confusing difference to be
        aware of in the <em>type</em> of the index variable. To output the
        values in the array <tt>a</tt> one would normally use a loop idiom
        like the following: 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
int i;
for (i=0; i&lt;10; i++) cout &lt;&lt; a[i];
</pre>
        If we try the same thing with vector <tt>v</tt>, i.e. 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
int i;
for (i=0; i&lt;10; i++) cout &lt;&lt; v[i];
</pre>
        it may in fact work, but an up-to-date compiler will at least warn
        you that the index variable <tt>i</tt> has the "wrong" type, and
        the code should really be written like this: 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
vector&lt;int&gt;::size_type i;
for (i=0; i&lt;10; i++) cout &lt;&lt; v[i];
</pre>
        The reason for this is that the <tt>int</tt> data type has values
        (all the negative ones) that cannot possibly be valid indices for a
        vector. Thus the <tt>vector</tt> class would like to be sure that
        we always use non-negative index values when accessing vector
        components and provides for us a <tt>typedef</tt> alias called
        <tt>size_type</tt> (an unsigned integral type) for just this
        purpose.
      </li>
      <li>
        <big>A vector, unlike an array, has self-knowledge: it knows how
        big it is</big> When outputting values for an array, the programmer
        needs to know the size of the array. Another advantage of a vector
        over an array is that (because the vector is a <em>class
        object</em>) the vector knows its own size. Hence we can (and
        should) write 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
vector&lt;int&gt;::size_type i;
for (i=0; i&lt;v.size(); i++) cout &lt;&lt; v[i];
</pre>
        which will work for any vector of whatever size. We no longer need
        to know and remember that (in the above case) the size of the
        vector <tt>v</tt> is 10.
      </li>
      <li><big>Component initialization</big> Unlike <tt>a</tt>, <tt>v</tt>
      is a <em>class object</em>, and we have used one of several
      constructors from the <tt>vector</tt> container class to create
      <tt>v</tt>. Among other things, this means that each element of
      <tt>v</tt> is guaranteed to be initialized with the default value of
      the component type (0 here, since the component type is
      <tt>int</tt>). On the other hand, the elements of <tt>a</tt> may or
      may not be initialized to 0, depending on where the declaration is
      located in the program, for example.</li>
      <li>
        <big>Adding new elements</big> Once declared as above, the size of
        <tt>a</tt> is fixed and cannot be altered later in the program. But
        the vector class contains a <tt>push_back()</tt> member function
        which can be used like this 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
v.push_back(17);
</pre>
        to add the value 17 (for example) to the end of the vector. After
        execution of this statement the size of the vector <tt>v</tt> has
        increased to 11 and <tt>v[10]</tt> contains the value 17. (Remember
        that the first 10 values of <tt>v</tt> are all 0, and are found in
        the locations with indices in the range 0..9.) This ability of a
        vector to "grow" in order to accommodate the addition of new values
        to its "back end" is one of the major advantages of vectors over
        arrays.
      </li>
      <li>
        <big>Initializing a vector with elements from an array</big>
        Although declaring an empty array, as in 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
int a[0];
</pre>
        makes no sense, since nothing can ever be stored in it, declaring
        an empty vector and then adding some values makes perfect sense: 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
vector&lt;int&gt; v;  //construct an empty vector to hold some integers
v.push_back(3); // v now contains 3 in v[0]
v.push_back(6); // v now contains 3 in v[0], 6 in v[1]
v.push_back(4); // v now contains 3 in v[0], 6 in v[1], 4 in v[2]
</pre>
        This is clearly a rather laborious and inconvenient way to get
        values into a vector. Since an array containing the same values can
        be initialized with the statement 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
int a[3] = {3, 6, 4};
</pre>
        or even 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
int a[] = {3, 6, 4};
</pre>
        one might hope that something like 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
vector&lt;int&gt; v = {3. 6, 4}; //syntax error!
</pre>
        would work for vectors, but unfortunately (as the comment
        indicates) this does not work. However, a useful way of combining
        the old and the new to initialize a vector with a sequence of
        specific values is illustrated by the following two lines of code: 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
int a[] = {3, 6, 4};   //initialize array a first
vector&lt;int&gt; v(a, a+3); //construct vector v containing values from a
</pre>
        This vector definition (declaration with initialization) requires a
        few words of explanation. We are using another constructor from the
        <tt>vector</tt> class, this time the one that takes two input
        parameters which are "iterators" (or in this case, ordinary
        pointers acting as iterators) pointing at the beginning element,
        and "one-past-the-last" element of a range of values to be placed
        in the newly constructed vector. In this case the first parameter
        (<tt>a</tt>), is a pointer to the first element of the array
        <tt>a</tt>, and the second parameter (<tt>a+3</tt>) is a pointer to
        the "first position beyond the last element" of the array
        <tt>a</tt>. This notion of a "range" of elements being determined
        by a pair of iterators (or pointers) pointing to the first element
        and "one-past-the-last" element (as opposed to the last element
        itself) of a sequence of values permeates the STL and is something
        beginning STL programmers need to get a handle on right up front.
        An even better way to create <tt>v</tt> with the values from
        <tt>a</tt> would be 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
int a[] = {3, 6, 4}; //initialize array a first
vector&lt;int&gt; v(a, a+sizeof(a)/sizeof(int)); //construct v with values from a
</pre>
        which works independently of the size of the array <tt>a</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <big>Vector iterators</big> The STL <tt>vector</tt> class provides
        an <tt>iterator</tt> which can be used to access the component
        values of any vector in the same way that ordinary pointers are
        used to access array elements. The member function <tt>begin()</tt>
        returns an <tt>iterator</tt> object pointing to the first component
        of the vector on which it is invoked and the member function
        <tt>end()</tt> returns an <tt>iterator</tt> object pointing to
        one-past-the-last component. The fact that it is one-past-the-last
        and not the last makes it convenient when writing a loop to process
        all vector elements, as in the following example. 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
int a[] = {3, 6, 4}; //initialize array a first
vector&lt;int&gt; v(a, a+sizeof(a)/sizeof(int)); //construct v with values from a
vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator p; //declare an iterator for a vector of integers
for (p=v.begin(); p!=v.end(); p++) cout &lt;&lt; *p &lt;&lt; " "; //output all values of v
</pre>
        Note that the <tt>iterator</tt> object <tt>p</tt> is incremented in
        the same way that an ordinary array pointer would be incremented,
        and that <tt>*p</tt> is used to dereference <tt>p</tt> and get
        access to the value to which <tt>p</tt> is pointing, once again in
        the same way that a pointer would be dereferenced to gain access to
        an array element.
      </li>
      <li>
        <big>Using algorithms and function objects with vectors</big> One
        particularly nice feature of the STL is that it provides a large
        collection of algorithms that perform many of the common
        programming tasks that programmers frequently need to have done in
        their programs. Most of those algorithms are available from the
        <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> header, but a few are located in the
        <tt>&lt;numeric&gt;</tt> header. To quickly get a sense of how this
        works, look at this code 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
...
sort(v.begin(), v.end());
</pre>
        which shows the STL <tt>sort</tt> algorithm being used to sort the
        values in a vector. By default this algorithm sorts in ascending
        order and will work for a vector of any items whatsoever, as long
        as <tt>operator&lt;()</tt> is defined for the components of
        <tt>v</tt>, so that the sort algorithm knows what it means for one
        component to precede another. If a sort in descending order is
        required instead, this can be accomplished with 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;functional&gt;
...
sort(v.begin(), v.end(), greater&lt;T&gt;());
</pre>
        in which <tt>T</tt> must be the component type of <tt>v</tt>, and
        the expression <tt>greater&lt;T&gt;()</tt> provides a <em>function
        object</em> (from STL's built-in collection of function objects,
        available from the header <tt>&lt;functional&gt;</tt>) that tells
        the sort algorithm to change its thinking to consider one component
        as preceding another when it is <em>greater than</em> the other
        (which requires that <tt>operator&gt;()</tt> be defined for the
        component type of the vector). Many STL algorithms have an
        overloaded version that permits their default behavior to be
        altered by providing an additional function object parameter (or
        ordinary function parameter) which is used by the algorithm to help
        it perform its task in a different way. 
        <p>As a second example of an STL algorithm applied to a vector,
        consider</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
...
cout &lt;&lt; *max_element(v.begin(), v.end()) &lt;&lt; endl;
</pre>
        which outputs the "largest" value in the vector (whatever that
        means for the given vector). The <tt>max_element</tt> algorithm
        actually returns an <tt>iterator</tt> object pointing to the
        largest value, rather than the largest value itself. This is why we
        have to dereference the return value of the algorithm: to obtain,
        for output, the value to which the returned <tt>iterator</tt>
        object is pointing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <big>Vector assignment and comparisons</big> A number of other
        operations are available for vectors that that have no counterpart
        when you are working with arrays. For example, it is possible to
        assign one vector to another, as in 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
v1 = v2;
</pre>
        and the relational operators also work with vectors, so that you
        can make tests like 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
if (v1 == v2)
...
</pre>
        or 
<pre xml:space="preserve">
if (v1 &lt; v2)
...
</pre>
        provided you understand how these things work. Assignment of
        vectors works just like assignment always works (or should work)
        ... the thing on the right of the assignment operator replaces the
        thing on the left of the assignment operator. The relational
        operators are potentially a little trickier. We can summarize the
        situation by saying the comparisons are "lexicographic". That's a
        big word meaning this: when two vectors are being compared (to see
        if one is "less than" the other, for example), corresponding pairs
        of components are compared (starting at the beginning) until a
        determination can be made. How the vectors compare is determined by
        how the first two components that are different compare. That is,
        if the component in the first vector is less than the corresponding
        component in the second vector, then the first vector is itself
        less than the second vector. This is just like "alphabetic"
        comparison, but instead of comparing letters you are comparing
        components (whatever they may be). This of course implies that
        components can in fact be compared.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Now what?</h3>
    <p>In this brief introduction you have seen just one of the STL
    container types (vector) and you have seen how much more versatile
    vectors are than arrays. You have also seen how STL algorithms can be
    used to manipulate or "process" the components of a vector through
    iterators. All of this just scratches the surface, of course, but it
    should give you a reasonable sense of "how things work" in the STL, at
    least enough to get you started.</p>
    <p>What you need to do now is learn about some of the other STL
    containers (deque, list, map, multimap, set, multiset) and container
    adaptors (stack, queue, priority_queue), and get familiar with as many
    of the STL algorithms as you can manage. In doing so you will also want
    to learn more about how iterators behave and about the iterator
    adaptors for streams that are very convenient for I/O operations. And
    do not forget that function objects can be usefully employed in many
    different situations when using the STL, so you should make sure that
    function objects are in your personal STL toolkit if you expect to
    become a competent STL programmer.</p>
    <p>As you learn about these new STL features, you should be struck by
    how much what you already know about vectors carries over to the other
    containers, particularly if your very next step is to digest the <a
    href="cont_vector.html">detail page on vectors</a> provided on this web
    site. So ... that's what we recommend. Do note, however, that that page
    is a reference page, not a tutorial page. But you will also find there
    a large number of sample programs that should show you nearly all you
    would ever need to know about vectors, and a few other things along the
    way.</p>
