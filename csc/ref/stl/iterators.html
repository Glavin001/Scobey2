     STL Iterators and Iterator Adaptors</p>
    <p>An STL iterator may be thought of as a generalized array pointer,
    which usually (but not always) points to a container component and is
    used to provide access to the value in that component for various
    purposes. This page contains a discussion of what is meant by an STL
    "range", and five tables:</p>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>A table showing the five iterator types and the operations each
      provides.</li>
      <li>A table showing the type of iterator provided by each
      (first-class) container with its <tt>iterator</tt> typedef. (The
      container adaptor classes&mdash;stack, queue and
      priority_queue&mdash; do not support iterators of any kind.)</li>
      <li>A table of iterator adaptors used with streams for input and
      output.</li>
      <li>A table of iterator adaptors used for insertion.</li>
      <li>A table of useful iterator functions.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>What is meant by an STL <em>range</em>?</h3>
    <p>One of the first ideas a programmer needs to grasp when dealing with
    the STL is the idea of an STL <em>range</em>, as given by a pair of
    iterators.</p>
    <p>Probably the best analogy for an STL range is the notion of a
    half-open interval of integer values in mathematics, for which the
    notation is <span class="nowrap"><tt>[a,b)</tt></span>, where the
    relationship of <tt>a</tt> to <tt>b</tt> is understood to be <span
    class="nowrap"><tt>a &lt; b</tt></span>. This notation means the
    collection of all values from <tt>a</tt> to <tt>b</tt>, including
    <tt>a</tt> but <em>not</em> including <tt>b</tt>. Similar notation may
    have any of the four possible combinations of round and square
    brackets, and the meaning is that the value adjacent to a square
    bracket <em>is</em> in the set, but the value adjacent to a round
    bracket is <em>not</em> in the set. In all cases, all values strictly
    between the two values <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> <em>are</em> in the
    set.</p>
    <p>In the context of the STL we use a similar notation to mean a
    similar thing. For example, we might use <span
    class="nowrap"><tt>[iterBegin,iterEnd)</tt></span> to refer to the
    collection of all iterator values from <tt>iterBegin</tt> to
    <tt>iterEnd</tt>, including <tt>iterBegin</tt> but not including
    <tt>iterEnd</tt>. This is a rocky shoal upon which many an STL
    programmer has foundered (particularly beginners).</p>
    <h3 class="pagebreak">The five iterator types</h3>
    <p>Any given iterator is a class object, and there are (conceptually)
    five types of iterators, as shown in the table below. These iterators
    are listed in order from "most powerful" (random access iterators) to
    "least powerful" (output iterators).</p>

        <td valign="middle"><tt>* = ++</tt></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Some notes on the above table:</p>
    <ul class="hardleft">
      <li>In the iterator descriptions we could just as easily have used
      the terms "read" and "write" where we used "retrieve" and "store".
      The "reading and writing" terminology is particularly appropriate if
      the iterator in question is being used on an "input stream" or
      "output stream", either of which may often be regarded as a
      "container" in the STL sense.</li>
      <li>Element access for reading and writing is performed via the
      <tt>*</tt> dereference operator, in a manner precisely analogous to
      the way in which this operator is employed in the "usual" pointer
      context.</li>
      <li>In general, if a certain kind of iterator is required for a
      certain kind of access in a given context, a more powerful iterator
      can also be used for the same kind of access in the same
      context.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="pagebreak">Container classes and their associated iterator
    types</h3>
    <p>The table below shows, first of all, that the container adaptors
    have <em>no</em> iterators. Each of the other classes (the three
    sequential containers and the four associative containers) has a
    default iterator of the type shown. Any such iterator is obtained by
    declaring an object in a manner analogous to the declaration
    <br />
     <tt>vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator iter;</tt>
    <br />
     which supplies an iterator <tt>iter</tt> capable of pointing at the
    elements in a vector container of values of type <tt>int</tt>. Each of
    the seven container classes that have iterators has a typedef name
    called <tt>iterator</tt> which is an alias for the class (i.e., the
    type) of iterator that "goes with" that particular container class of
    values. There is more to the story, of course, but that gives the
    general idea.</p>

    <h3 class="pagebreak" id="stream_iterators">Iterator adaptors for
    streams (stream iterators)</h3>
    <p>Sometimes a class will have the functionality you seek but not the
    right interface for accessing that functionality. For example, the STL
    <tt>copy()</tt> algorithm requires a pair of input iterators as its
    first two parameters to give the range of values to be copied. An
    istream object can act as a source of such data values but it does not
    have any iterators that the copy algorithm can use.</p>
    <p>Similarly the third parameter of the <tt>copy()</tt> algorithm is an
    output iterator that directs the copied values to their proper
    destination. That destination could be an output stream but output
    streams do not directly provide any output iterators.</p>
    <p>An <em>adaptor class</em> is one that acts like a "translator" by
    "adapting" the messages you want to send to produce messages that the
    other class object wants to receive.</p>
    <p>There is an iterator adaptor class called <tt>istream_iterator</tt>
    that provides the interface that the <tt>copy()</tt> algorithm expects
    for input and translates requests from this algorithm into appropriate
    <tt>istream</tt> operations. And there is another one called
    <tt>ostream_iterator</tt> that provides the interface that the
    <tt>copy()</tt> algorithm expects for output and translates requests
    from the algorithm into appropriate <tt>ostream</tt> operations.</p>

    <p>Inserters (also called "insert iterators") are "iterator adaptors"
    that permit algorithms (the <tt>copy</tt> algorithm, for example) to
    operate in insert mode rather than overwrite mode, which is the
    default. Thus they solve the problem that crops up when an algorithm
    tries to write elements to a destination container not already big
    enough to hold them, by making the destination grow as needed. There
    are three kinds of inserters, as shown in the table below:</p>
    <ol class="hardleft">
      <li>The back_inserter(), which can be used if the recipient container
      supports the push_back() member function.</li>
      <li>The front_inserter(), which can be used if the recipient
      container supports the push_front() member function.</li>
