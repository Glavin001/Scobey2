     STL FAQ: A Few Questions and Answers</p>
    <p>These questions are of the rhetorical variety, by which I mean that
    they have been made up and answered by the page author, rather than
    collected from users. (This may even be taking liberties with the term
    "rhetorical".) In any case, they form a short and probably inadequate
    selection of some of the queries that might occur to a programmer upon
    a first encounter with the STL, from one person's point of view.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt class="faq">What is the STL?</dt>
      <dd>It's a sophisticated and powerful library of template classes and
      template functions that implement many common data structures and
      algorithms, and forms part of the C++ Standard Library.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt class="faq">Who developed the STL?</dt>
      <dd>The STL was developed at Hewlett Packard by Alexander Stepanov,
      with major contributions by David Musser and Meng Lee. It was deemed
      by the C++ Standards Committee to be so important to the future of
      C++ that the approval of the C++ Standard was delayed for several
      years so that the STL could be incorporated into that Standard. A
      version of the Standard that incorporated the STL was first approved
      in the fall of 1998.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt class="faq">Why should a C++ programmer be interested in the
      STL?</dt>
      <dd>Because the STL embodies the concept of <em>reusable software
      components</em>, and provides off-the-shelf solutions to a wide
      variety of programming problems. It is also <em>extensible</em>, in
      the sense that any programmer can write new software (containers and
      algorithms, for example), that "fit in" to the STL and work with the
      already-existing parts of the STL, provided the programmer follows
      the appropriate design guidelines.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt class="faq">What is the design philosophy of the STL?</dt>
      <dd>The STL exemplifies <em>generic programming</em> rather than
      <em>object-oriented programming</em>, and derives its power and
      flexibility from the use of templates, rather than inheritance and
      polymorphism. It also avoids <tt>new</tt> and <tt>delete</tt> for
      memory management in favor of <em>allocators</em> for storage
      allocation and deallocation. The STL also provides <em>performance
      guarantees</em>, i.e., its specification requires that the containers
      and algorithms be implemented in such a way that a user can be
      confident of optimal runtime performance independent of the STL
      implementation being used.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt class="faq">What are the major components of the STL?</dt>
      <dd>The <em>containers</em> and <em>container adaptors</em> (both are
      objects that can hold other objects), the <em>iterators</em>
      (generalized pointers that point at items in containers), and the
      <em>algorithms</em> (that work on containers through iterators) will
      be the most frequently used components of the STL.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt class="faq">What are some other components of the STL?</dt>
      <dd>Other STL components include <em>function objects</em> (objects
      of a class that defines <tt>operator()</tt>), and <em>allocators</em>
      (which manage memory allocation and deallocation for containers).
      Function objects are essential for effective use of the STL, but the
      average user will be able to ignore allocators most of the time by
      simply accepting the default allocator for each container used.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt class="faq">How do you use the STL?</dt>
      <dd>By including the necessary header files to permit access to the
      parts of the STL that you need, by declaring objects of the
      appropriate container, iterator and function types, and then using
      member functions and/or algorithms, as appropriate, to perform
      whatever tasks your application requires. It is also generally
      necessary to ensure that whatever objects you plan to put into your
      container(s) are objects of classes that have a default constructor,
      a copy constructor, and an overloaded <tt>operator=</tt>. In
      addition, if you plan to sort or compare such container objects, the
      corresponding classes must provide definitions for
      <tt>operator==</tt> and <tt>operator&lt;</tt>. Finally, since it is
      often the case that different containers can be used in the same
      problem situation, the user needs to be able to make an appropriate
      choice for each occasion, and this choice will usually be based on
      performance characteristics.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt class="faq">What are some of the things a programmer should be
      aware of when using the STL?
      <br />
       (Many of these may not make sense until you have actually tried to
      use the STL.)</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul class="hardleft">
          <li>Understand member functions <tt>size()</tt>,
          <tt>max_size()</tt> and <tt>resize()</tt>.</li>
          <li>Understand member functions <tt>begin()</tt>, <tt>end()</tt>,
          <tt>rbegin()</tt> and <tt>rend()</tt>.</li>
          <li>Understand the fact that a reference to a "range" of values
          in STL generally means those values from (and including) the
          first value in the range up to (but not including) the last value
          in the range. Such a range can extend forward or backward,
          depending on the kinds of iterators being used.</li>
          <li>Even though it may (sometimes) work, it is better
          <em>not</em> use a loop like
          <br />
           <tt>for (i = c.begin(); i &lt; c.end(); i++) ...</tt>
          <br />
           for processing all the elements of a container <tt>c</tt>; it is
          preferable instead to use a loop like this:
          <br />
           <tt>for (i = c.begin(); i != c.end(); i++) ...</tt>
          <br />
           This second form is often necessary, in fact, since not all
          container iterators support <tt>operator&lt;</tt>.</li>
          <li>Remember that the container adaptors (<tt>stack</tt>,
          <tt>queue</tt>, <tt>priority_queue</tt>) have <em>no</em>
          iterators.</li>
          <li>
            Know that any <tt>insert()</tt> member function applied to a
            container may (or may not) invalidate iterators and references
            already pointing at elements of that container. In particular: 
            <ul class="hardleft">
              <li>It is safest to assume that insert() applied to a deque
              or a vector will invalidate any iterators or references to
              elements of the deque or vector.</li>
              <li>On the other hand, <tt>insert()</tt> applied to any of
              the <em>other</em> first-class containers (<tt>list</tt>,
              <tt>map</tt>, <tt>multimap</tt>, <tt>set</tt>,
              <tt>multiset</tt>) does <em>not</em> invalidate any of the
              iterators or references to elements of the container, and
              deletions from these containers invalidate only iterators or
              references to the elements deleted.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Remember that if you are using the STL for a given purpose in
          a situation that requires (as a minimal requirement) that a
          certain kind of iterator be used, a more powerful iterator may
          also be used in that situation</li>
          <li>Remember that if you have the choice between using an STL
          algorithm and using an STL container class method to accomplish
          the same purpose, you should prefer the class method.</li>
          <li>Know that any container that is the target of an algorithm
          must be large enough to hold all elements it will receive, since
          it will not automatically be increased in size. Or, plan to use
          an <em>inserter</em>.</li>
        </ul>
