    <br />
     for CSCI 2341 and CSCI 2342</p>
    <p><strong>This document provides information and guidelines regarding
    the preparation, submission, marking and return of programming
    submissions, both for the students who must prepare and submit them,
    and for any marker who must evaluate them. Everyone involved with the
    course is expected to be familiar with the contents of this
    document.</strong></p>
    <h3>Submission Guidelines (directed at students, but also for
    markers)</h3>
    <p>Each submission involving programming will be marked for "style" as
    well as "substance":</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>style</strong></dt>
      <dd>How good does it "look and feel"? In other words: Would the
      program be readable and understandable when another programmer looked
      at the source code, and would a user regard the program as having a
      pleasant "user interface" and being generally "user-friendly" when it
      runs?</dd>
      <dt><strong>substance</strong></dt>
      <dd>How well does it work? In other words: Does it give the required,
      correct results in the proper form? Of course, the real "substance"
      question for any program is this: Does the program satisfy its
      original specifications and work correctly for all valid input
      values, including the supplied data (if any), and does it perform any
      required error handling properly?</dd>
    </dl>
    <p><big><em>Student responsibilities for preparing MINT-condition
    submissions</em></big>
    <br />
     Every student must recognize that it is his or her responsibility to
    prepare each programming submission according to the problem
    specifications, the specific instructions for that submission, and our
    general guidelines, and to submit it on time in the manner specified.
    Submissions to be marked will normally be made via the web, but this
    may vary from time to time. <big>MINT</big> is an easily-remembered
    acronym to help you remember what must be true about any submission
    before you submit it. You must make sure that each submission is in
    <big><strong>MINT</strong></big> condition, by which we mean:</p>
    <ul class="hardleft">
      <li><big><strong>M</strong></big> In the opinion of the
      <big><strong>M</strong></big>마rker, your submission must meet a
      <big><strong>M</strong></big>말nimal standard of functionality, style
      and overall organization. In particular, if it does not compile, link
      and run, so that you can provide an appropriate executable, or if the
      marker can't make sense of your source code, major penalties will
      apply.</li>
      <li><big><strong>I</strong></big> Every submission must be
      <big><strong>I</strong></big>맋entified properly, according to the
      current requirements as specified by the course instructor. If it
      isn't, penalties will apply.</li>
      <li><big><strong>N</strong></big> All files submitted must be
      <big><strong>N</strong></big>마med as required in the submission
      description. <em>If they aren't, one or more of them may be missed by
      any processing software that deals with the submission, including the
      brain of the marker. No file missed for this reason will be accepted
      after the fact. Care must be taken to ensure that a source code file
      is not submitted as an executable, or vice versa.</em></li>
      <li><big><strong>T</strong></big> Each submission must be made on
      <big><strong>T</strong></big>말me. If it isn't, it's
      <em>unacceptable</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The need to follow instructions carefully when performing any kind
    of programming activity cannot be overemphasized. There are general
    rules to follow for all submissions, and sometimes particular rules
    apply only to the current submission. These current-submission rules,
    if present, may either override, or simply augment the general rules
    (another example of "local taking precedence over global", if you
    like). Local rules for a given submission (if any) will appear in the
    specifications for that submission.</p>
    <p>Study very carefully the following general guidelines for program
    development. Note in particular the need to properly identify both
    program source code and program executables.</p>
    <ul class="hardleft">
      <li><big>Get started early, work steadily, submit frequently, and
      plan to make the final submission at least five minutes before the
      deadline.</big>
      <br />
       Does this need any further comment?</li>
      <li><big>Look before you leap into program development.</big>
      <br />
       Read completely through the entire description before starting to
      work on any required submission. This will help ensure that you
      follow any explicit instructions that apply only to that particular
      submission, and that you <em>don't</em> waste time doing things that
      you <em>shouldn't</em> be doing for that particular submission. If
      specific instructions for a particular aspect of a problem are not
      given, you may exercise your own judgment as to how that part of the
      work should be done, but you will be expected to conform, within
      reason, to the general approach to program development discussed in
      class and illustrated in the relevant examples seen in class and in
      lab.</li>
      <li><big>Follow the required programming style guidelines.</big>
      <br />
       These style guidelines will not be repeated here, since they are
      covered on a <a href="index_style.html">separate page</a>.</li>
      <li><big>Test any program carefully before submitting it for
      evaluation.</big>
      <br />
       Always use the exact data supplied (if any) or the kind of data
      suggested (if any) to test the version of your program that you
      intend to submit, although you will of course often want to (or have
      to) use additional, or other, test data in the process of developing
      your program. Markers may use a standard set of test data to test
      your program, and it may be test data that you have not seen.</li>
      <li>
        <big>Identify your source code and executable properly.</big>
        <br />
         
        <ul class="hardleft">
          <li><b>Identification of source code</b>
          <br />
           All source code files submitted must be identified by including
          at the beginning of the file one or more comments having the form
          specified elsewhere by the course instructor.</li>
          <li><b>Identification of executables</b>
          <br />
           When a program runs, it must also identify itself and/or the
          programmer who created it, and possibly provide some additional
          information, using the format and having the content specified
          elsewhere by the instructor.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><big>Your program must provide any required descriptive text
      and/or on-line help</big>
      <br />
       Whatever additional information the program must display when it
      runs, if any--such as on-line help or a more elaborate description of
      its purpose and usage--will be described as part of the description
      of the requirements for each particular submission, or will be shown
      by the sample executable, if any.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a id="marking" name="marking">Marking Guidelines (directed at
    markers, but also for students)</a></h3>
    <p>Markers, as well as students, should keep in mind that any submitted
    program must be complete, correct and understandable, if full marks are
    to be awarded. In other words, not only "substance" but also "style" is
    important in the construction of a computer program. Another thing to
    keep in mind is that there are always two major aspects of a computer
    program to consider when evaluating that program: first, the source
    code; and second, the output from the executable code when it runs.</p>
    <p>From time to time students may also be required to submit additional
    material relevant to a submitted program, design documentation of some
    kind, or a help file. For more complex programs than we will be
    writing, a User Guide and additional "external" documentation would be
    necessary, and would have their own requirements.</p>
    <p>The question of just how a submitted program should be evaluated is
    always a thorny one. For full credit the student's solution must, of
    course, conform in all details to the particular specifications of the
    given submission as well as the general guidelines contained herein. To
    make a full assessment of the submission the marker may need to
    consider, and will certainly find helpful, the student's own assessment
    of that submission, so students must not forget to include their
    assessments in their submissions. Your self-assessment of your
    submission should appear in a brief comment after the blank line
    following the required comments at the beginning of your file. It may
    simply say that you consider your submission to be complete and working
    as required, or outline briefly whatever problems you were unable to
    resolve.</p>
    <p>When a marker begins to evaluate a student's submission, he or she
    expects to see something that has been produced in accordance with the
    general guidelines set out herein, as well as the specifications set
    out in the description of the given submission. It should work
    correctly and have a good "user interface" when it runs. And the source
    code should be understandable, i.e., the marker should be able to see,
    without difficulty, by looking at the source code, that the program
    does work correctly, as well as how and why it works correctly and does
    what it does.</p>
    <p>If this <em>is</em> the case, the student can expect, and the marker
    should allot, full marks. If this is <em>not</em> the case, the student
    can expect to have marks deducted, and markers are obliged to deduct
    marks.</p>
    <p>The difficult question is always this one: How many marks should be
    deducted for which omissions or which transgressions? One problem is
    that questions of style do not have right and wrong answers. But that
    is why we have gone to some trouble to make our style expectations
    explicit, and students should realize that if they continue to ignore
    these guidelines, they do so at their own peril. And it is worth
    pointing out as well that these are not arbitrary guidelines. For the
    most part, they are the condensed wisdom of several decades of
    programming experience in North America and elsewhere, and grew out of
    the hard lesson that when programmers program without such guidelines,
    sooner or later chaos reigns.</p>
    <p>Consistency is a very important criterion in marking, but one that
    is almost impossible to achieve in the full sense of the word. All we
    can reasonably expect is that markers will do their best.</p>
    <p>Finally, we point out that if a marker observes a particular student
    continuing to violate a particular guideline after being warned, that
    marker is free to increase the amount of any previous point deduction
    for that particular infraction.</p>
    <p><big><em>Evaluation of program readability (i.e., program source
    code)</em></big>
    <br />
     When evaluating the source code of a program, items to be considered
    will include, but need not be limited to, the following:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Identification</strong></dt>
      <dd>Has the program been properly identified, according to the
      standard method of identification established for the course?
      <br />
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Formatting (spacing, indentation, alignment, grouping)</strong></dt>
      <dd>Is the horizontal and vertical spacing adequate for good
      readability?
      <br />
       - By <em>horizontal spacing</em> we mean blank spaces, since TAB
      characters should <em>never</em> appear in source code.
      <br />
       - By vertical spacing we mean blank lines and/or page breaks.
      <br />
       Are indentation and alignment used properly and consistently?
      <br />
       Are logically distinct sections of code separated appropriately?
      <br />
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Self-documentation</strong></dt>
      <dd>Are there enough, too many, too few, inappropriate, or no
      comments?
      <br />
       Do all functions have appropriate pre-conditions and
      post-conditions?
      <br />
       Does each function parameter have an <tt>in</tt>, an <tt>out</tt>,
      or an <tt>inout</tt> comment?
      <br />
       Are the identifiers meaningful?
      <br />
       Does every <em>void function name</em> start with a <em>verb</em>?
      <br />
       Have <em>named constants</em> been used where appropriate?
      <br />
       Is capitalization ("camel-style", in general) used properly and
      consistently?</dd>
      <dt><strong>Program structure and overall organization</strong></dt>
      <dd>Is the program properly structured?
      <br />
       Is the logical flow of the program clear from its structure?
      <br />
       Is each class properly structured?</dd>
    </dl>
    <p><big><em>Evaluation of user interface and executable
    output</em></big>
    <br />
     When evaluating the output when a program is executed, items to be
    considered will include, but need not be limited to, the following:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Identification</strong></dt>
      <dd>Does the program identify both itself and the programmer properly
      in the output, if and as required?
      <br />
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Self-description</strong></dt>
      <dd>Does the program describe itself properly in the output, if and
      as required?
      <br />
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>On-line help</strong></dt>
      <dd>Does the program provide on-line help, if and as required?
      <br />
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Prompting for input</strong></dt>
      <dd>Does the program prompt the user properly for all required input?
      <br />
       Does the program make all options clear to the user?
      <br />
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Echoing of input in the output</strong></dt>
      <dd>Does the program echo, in the output, any input that would enable
      the user to verify that the program had received the correct input
      values, if and as required?
      <br />
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Organization of output</strong></dt>
      <dd>Are items in the output grouped logically and separated
      appropriately?
      <br />
       Is the order of items in the output appropriate/correct?
      <br />
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Formatting of output</strong></dt>
      <dd>Is the horizontal and vertical spacing adequate for good
      readability?
      <br />
       Are indentation and alignment used properly and consistently?
      <br />
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Correctness of output</strong></dt>
      <dd>Does the program work correctly and produce the correct output?
      <br />
       Has the supplied data (if any) been used?
      <br />
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p><big><em>General evaluation considerations</em></big></p>
    <ul class="hardleft">
      <li>Have all specifications peculiar to the given problem been
      followed?</li>
      <li>Are grammar, spelling, phrasing and punctuation correct and
      appropriate?</li>

      <li>To become familiar with the marking guidelines outlined herein,
      as well as the coding style guidelines for the course</li>
      <li>To read each required submission's description to become familiar
      with it and any additional particular specifications it may contain,
      before beginning to mark that submission</li>

      out herein, any special instructions that may apply to a particular
      submission, and/or any additional or alternate instructions supplied
      by the instructor</li>
      <li>To place on each returned submission hard copy (or marking sheet)
      a final mark out of the possible maximum for that submission. This
      mark should represent a fair assessment (as a percentage) of how well
      the student has completed the submission according to the guidelines
      and instructions.</li>
      <li>To indicate (briefly) on each returned paper the reason(s) for

      marks for each student</li>
      <li>To respond, within a reasonable time period, to any student
      e-mail queries concerning the marking of a submission (In this
      regard, markers should be aware that students know that if there is a
