C++ Programming Style Conventions for CSCI 2341 and CSCI 2342
</p>

<p>
<strong>
Programming Style is, of course, a "matter of style",
and therefore different programmers will have different
ideas about what constitutes "good style".  When programmers
work together, however, it is not a good idea for each
programmer to pick his or her own style.  Consistency
suffers immediately, and, in the long term if not in
the short, so does readability.  It is therefore extremely
important for any programmer to get used to writing code
that conforms to a certain style, even if that style is
not necessarily the one that programmer would have chosen.
The style rules and guidelines that we will employ are
described and illustrated under the two links below.
