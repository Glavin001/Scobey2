    <p class="pageheader">General Rules and Policies for CSCI 2341 and
    2342</p>
    <ul class="hardleft">
      <li><font size="3"><strong>Registration</strong> You must be formally
      registered, via the Registrar&rsquo;s office, in both the class itself
      and the lab.</font></li>
      <li><font size="3"><strong>Signup</strong>You must sign up for the
      protected part of the course web site at that point in the course when
      you are asked to do so by the course instructor, since this is required
      for you to have the necessary access to protected areas of the site. By
      completing this signup you agree to adhere to the rules and policies
      set out in this document that you are now reading.</font></li>
      <li><font size="3"><strong>Attendance</strong> Students are expected to
      attend both lectures and labs, and to be punctual in doing so.
      Habitually showing up in class ten or fifteen minutes after the class
      has begun will not be tolerated. And any registered student who has not
      made an appearance in class or lab by the end of the second full week
      of classes, or who "disappears" from the course without notice for an
      extended period later on in the term, will be deemed to have withdrawn
      from the course.</font></li>
      <li>
        <font size="3"><strong>Tests and Exams</strong> No student will be
        permitted to write the final examination early, for
        <strong>any</strong> reason. If, for medical or other legitimate
        reasons, you are unable to write a test or the final exam at the
        scheduled time, you must so inform the instructor at the earliest
        possible opportunity, and other arrangements <strong>may</strong> be
        made. Similarly, if you have or develop a medical condition or other
        problem that is affecting, or is likely to affect, your performance
        in the course over the long term, your instructor must be notified at
        the earliest opportunity. With respect to the final examination, the
        following specific rules are in effect:</font> 
        <ul class="hardleft">
          <li>All students are expected to write the exam at the scheduled
          time. Simply "needing more time" is <em>not</em> a valid reason for
          missing the final exam. Neither is having two exams in one
          day.</li>
          <li>If a student cannot write at the scheduled time, the instructor
          must be notified at or before the start time of the exam. Only in
          the most dire of circumstances will a failure to conform to this
          rule be waived and a student be permitted to write late. The days
          of students waltzing in two or three days after an exam, or
          whenever, saying they missed the exam for some vague reason, and
          then expecting to write that exam, are over.</li>
          <li>Documentation supporting the reason for missing the examination
          must be submitted to the instructor as soon as possible after the
          exam, and in no case later than three days (72 hours) following the
          start time of the exam. The instructor reserves the right to
          confirm the validity of the supporting documentation with the
          issuer. Be advised that a dim view will be taken of any note, even
          from a doctor or nurse, that says anything like, "So-and-so tells
          me he/she had a whatever ailment on whenever date and could not
          write the test/exam."</li>
          <li>All those who miss the final exam and are permitted to write
          late must write at the same time, and will be permitted to arrange
          a time among themselves that is also agreeable to the instructor.
          If the parties are unable to agree upon a time, the instructor will
          set a time, which will be the final (and only) opportunity to write
          the missed exam.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li type="disc">
        <font size="3"><strong>Cooperative Effort vs.
        Plagiarism</strong> Saint Mary's University has reasonably strict
        guidelines with respect to plagiarism and cheating. There used to be
        a link here to a booklet produced by SMUSA on the subject but that
        link seems to have gone away. So, as far as this course is concerned,
        working with other students to exchange ideas and to solve problems
        is encouraged. But, copying another person&rsquo;s work directly,
        electronically or otherwise, or having someone use your account or
        another account to complete work for you is strictly forbidden. Any
        such practice is subject to severe penalties, and the following
        specific policy will be in place for the duration of this
        course:</font> 
        <ul class="hardleft">
          <li><font size="3">All submitted assignments, projects, tests, and
          exams (that is, every submission for course marks) must consist
          entirely of work done only by the student making the submission,
          unless explicit permission for a joint submission is given. That
          is, unless explicitly noted otherwise, every pen stroke or key
          stroke of work submitted by each student must have been done by the
          student whose name appears on the submission, and no unauthorized
          team work of any kind will be accepted for these submissions. On
          the other hand, discussion of the basic ideas involved in an
          assignment or project is encouraged. It is the actual work done to
          produce the solution&mdash;the physical effort, if you
          will&mdash;that must be done individually by each
          student.</font></li>
          <li>If a team effort is explicitly permitted for one or more
          submissions, the above rule applies to the team collectively, as
          well as each individual on the team.</li>
          <li><font size="3">Each student taking this course is expected to
          be aware of this policy and is advised that the penalty for a
          breach of it may include the forfeiture of a pass in the course,
          irrespective of the grade achieved, and irrespective of whether the
          student (or team) has <strong>supplied or received</strong> work
          passed from one student (or team) to another for inclusion in any
          formal submission of a homework assignment, test or
          exam.</font></li>
          <li><font size="3">Violations of this policy will be reported, with
          details, to the Dean of Science and to the Registrar, along with a
          recommendation for disciplinary action.</font></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font size="3"><strong>Cell Phones</strong> Cell phones must either
      not be brought to class or lab, or be turned off during the class or
      lab period. If you are expecting a telephone call which absolutely
      <em>must</em> be answered during a particular class or lab time, don't
      come to that class or lab. In other words, there is a zero tolerance
      for cell phones in the classes and lab sessions of this
      course.</font></li>
